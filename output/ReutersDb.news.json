We do need to do something with those currencies or wewill be substituting Japanese products for Taiwanese products,or those of other nations with currencies tied to the dollar,Baldrige told a House banking subcommittee.    The U.S. dollar has declined in value against the Yen andEuropean currencies, but has changed very little against thecurrencies of some developing countries such as South Korea andTaiwan because they are linked to the value of the dollar.    As a result, efforts to reduce the value of the dollar overthe past year and a half have done little to improve the tradedeficits with those countries.    Baldrige told a House Banking subcommittee that theTreasury Department was attempting to persuade those countriesto reach agreement with the United States on exchange rates."

Jim Billington, Farm Credit Administration FCA boardmember told a House Agriculture Appropriations subcommitteehearing I feel your subcommittee should plan on providing atleast 800 mln next year to assist the Farm Credit System.    However, FCA board member Marvin Duncan differed, sayingit is premature to talk about the cost of a solution until weknow what kind of solution.    Chairman of the FCA board, Frank Naylor, said it might bepossible to structure a rescue of the system with governmentguarantees or a line of credit which requires little or noupfront government money.    However, Billington said Congress must provide helpimmediately because this system needs some assurance that itwill get some help.    The FCA estimates the system could lose up to 1.4 billiondlrs in 1987, exhausting the remainder of its working capital,Naylor said.    The farm credit system is expected to present its ownproposals for government aid to a Senate Agriculturesubcommittee hearing on Thursday.    Naylor said the Treasury Department is continuing to refineReagan administration ideas on how a rescue should bestructured.

Bywaters remarks came as the White House Economic PolicyCouncil prepared for a Thursday meeting to decide whatsanctions if any should be taken against Japan for alleged violations of a U.S.Japanese semiconductors agreement.    The pact, agreed to last July, called for Tokyo to endselling semiconductors at below cost and to open its homemarket to U.S. goods. In return, Washington agreed to foregoantidumping duties on Japanese semiconductors.    But U.S. officials have said that while Japan has stoppeddumping in the U.S. market, it has not ended third countrydumping nor has it opened its market to U.S. semiconductors.    Japan yesterday, in an effort to ward off U.S. action,ordered a cutback in semiconductors production as a way toforce prices up and end the dumping.    Bywater, in his statement, said he backed a Defense ScienceBoard task force proposal to set up a consortium to develop newelectronic products and manufacturing processes and make theU.S. industory more competitive.    But he added the industry could not wait for legislation topass and that action was required now to help the depressedelectronic industry.    Bywater said, I urge the Reagan Administration to take fulland severe action immediately against Japan by invoking theretaliatory steps that are permitted under U.S. law and GATTGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade."

  "title": "DOLLAR EXPECTED TO FALL DESPITE INTERVENTION",
  "body": "Central bank intervention in theforeign exchange markets succeeded in staunching the dollarslosses today, but senior dealers here believe the U.S. currencyis headed for a further retreat.    Although the intervention was widespread, dealers perceivethat the six major industrial nations have differing levels ofcommitment to their recent accord to stabilize currencies.    Moreover, hard economic realities hold greater sway overthe currency market than central bank intervention and theseargue for a further dollar decline, dealers said.    The market can be bigger than the central banks. Andeconomic fundamentals will always come to the fore, said adealer at one major U.S. bank.    As the dollar dropped to postWorld War II lows against theyen today foreign exchange traders said the Bank of Japan,Federal Reserve Board and Bank of England intervened in themarkets on behalf of the U.S. currency.    Reports of the authorities actions helped the dollarrecover to about 149.45 yen in New York this afternoon fromthe postwar low of 148.20 yen in the Far East. But it stillfailed to regain Mondays U.S. closing level of 150.0005 yen.    Tokyo dealers said the Bank of Japan bought one to 1.5billion dlrs in Tokyo today and may also have purchased dollarsyesterday in the U.S. via the Federal Reserve.    Meanwhile, there were strong rumors in New York that theFed also bought a modest amount of dollars around 148.50 yentoday. Talk also circulated that the Bank of England purchaseda small amount of dollars for yen.    The Feds last confirmed intervention was on January 28when it bought 50 mln dlrs in coordination with the Bank ofJapan. But on March 11 the Fed also was rumored to havesignalled displeasure with a dollar surge above 1.87 marks.    The authorities actions appeared to back up the February22 Paris pact between the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain,France and Canada under which the nations agreed to cooperateto foster exchange rate stability around prevailing levels.    But foreign exchange dealers were not overly impressed bythe authorities intervention which they said can only softenextreme moves in the market.    For one thing, some dealers believed that the Fedspurchases were done on behalf of the Bank of Japan rather thanfor the U.S. central banks own account, suggesting a rather  watereddown American commitment to the currency accord.    The Bank of Englands action also was thought to becompleted on behalf of the Japanese central bank, reinforcingthe markets view that Japan is the most resolute of the sixnations in its support of the currency pact.    Noone doubts the Bank of Japan is serious. But the othertwo central banks seem to be making more token gestures thananything else, said Chris Bourdain of BankAmerica Corp.    Im not convinced the intervention was concerted, saidEarl Johnson of Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago. Its a yen problem more than anything else.    Some dealers said a rising wave of trade protectionistsentiment in the U.S. limits the extent to which the Americanauthorities can endorse a stronger dollar against the yen.    The dollars break below the key 150 yen level ties theTreasurys hands behind its back. The U.S. cannot intervene onits own account because of the strength of protectionism here,said Albert Soria of Swiss Bank Corp.    Such comments reflect the view that the currency marketsare becoming increasingly politicized. Despite officialdenials, some traders still feel the U.S. would countenance alower dollar to help trim the nations trade deficit.    The majority of the 170 billion dlr merchandise tradedeficit in 1986 was with Japan.    Indeed U.S. Treasury secretary James Bakers comment onSunday that the February currency pact had not establisheddollar targets was read by the market as a signal to sell theU.S. currency and kicked off the latest retreat.    The dollar still has more room on the downside against theyen based on the frictions in trade and financial services. Thecurrency market is becoming very political, said Natsuo Okadaof Sumitomo Bank Ltd.    Okada expects the dollar to trade between 148 and 150 yenthis week but sees the chance of a drop to 140 yen by the endof April or early May.    Even if West Germany and Japan succeed in stimulating theireconomies, it may not be enough to solve structural economicimbalances in the near future, dealers said.    Even if Japan and West Germany do expand this year, itwont be enough to help the trade situation much, saidBourdain of BankAmerica, who also expects the dollar to drop to148 yen in the next couple of days."

  "body": "Sales of U.S.made cars duringmidMarch, the traditional start of the spring selling season,dropped 3.9 pct behind last years level, analysts say.    Automakers sold about 204,000 cars in the March 1120selling period, 10,000 fewer than last year. Analysts said thedecline may auger poorly for the rest of the spring season.    Buyers shied away from the showrooms of American MotorsCorp AMO, the target of a 1.5 billion dlr takeover bid fromChrysler Corp C. Analysts said consumers were anxious aboutthe whether Chrysler will retain some American Motors models,causing a 62 pct drop in American Motors sales in midMarch.    Chryslers midMarch sales fell 3.6 pct.    During the spring selling season, you usually look forsome kind of seasonal uplift in sales. It doesnt look likeits happening, said Joseph Philippi, analyst with E.F. Huttonand Co.    There may be less bloom to the spring selling season thisyear than last, one auto company official conceded.    General Motors Corp GM, still working to regain consumerinterest in its cars, led the drop with a 14.8 pct decline.    Ford Motor Cos F sales increased 15.2 pct for theperiod. But analysts said the rise compares to a 1986 periodfor Ford, leaving it down 10 pct in two years.    The total industry midMarch sales was slightly lessthan expected, the company official said.    American Motors decline caught analysts eye. AmericanMotors took it on the chinbig, said Philippi.    Given the prospective takeover by Chrysler, people mightbe a little leary about going to American Motors dealers, hesaid.    American Motors sold 790 domestic cars in the period,meaning each of American Motors 1,050 dealers is selling a carabout every other day, Philippi said.    Potential American Motors buyers are afraid their carmodels might disappear, he said.    Chrysler, in its purchase agreement with American Motorsmajority stockholder Renault, has agreed not to undercutsales of American Motors new Medallion and Premier cars, madeby Renault.    On a company by company basis, sales of U.S. made cars fromthe March 11 to 20 period wereGM 105,438, down 14.8 pct, Ford67,672, up 15.2 pct, Chrysler 30,909, down 3.6 pct, AmericanMotors 790, down 6.2 pct, American Honda 7,447 compared with5,031, Nissan Motor Corp, 3,358, up 10.7 pct, Volkswagon U.S.Inc 1,330, down 35 pct."

  "body": "Resorts International Incsaid it received a proposal from KSZ Co Inc under whichholders of Resorts class B stock would receive 140 dlrs a sharein cash and one share of common stock in a new company to beformed through the takeover.    Under the offer, Resorts said holders of its class A shareswould receive 15 dlrs a share in cash and three shares ofcommon stock in the new company.    Resorts said the offer from KSZ calls for a merger ofResorts with RI Acquisition Co Inc, a newly formed Delawarecorporation.    Resorts said that prior to the merger, RI Acquisition wouldbe capitalized with about 100 mln dlrs of debt and about 220mln dlrs of equity.    It said 200 mln dlrs of the equity would be in the form ofspecial preferred stock.    The KSZ offer, Resorts said, indicates that KSZ has acommitment from M. Davies Cos to buy all of the specialpreferred stock.    Resorts said the offer will expire at 1700 EST on March 27.It said it asked its investment advisor, Bear, Stearns and Co,to advise its board on the offer.    Earlier this month, the estate of James M. Crosby andcertian members of his family agreed to sell their class Bshares to New York real estate tycoon Donald Trump for 135 dlrsa share. The estate and family members hold 78 pct of the752,297 class B shares outstanding.    Trump also agreed to pay 135 dlrs a share for the remainingclass B shares outstanding.    Resorts also has about 5,680,000 shares of outstandingclass A stock. These shares carry one onehundredth the votingpower of the class B shares.    Trumps offer beat out a rival bid of 135 dlrs a share madeby Pratt Hotel Corp PRAT.    Resorts said that under the proposal made by KSZ, existingclass A and class B shareholders would control about 96 pct ofthe outstanding common of the new company formed to acquireResorts.    Resorts said the new company, upon completion of themerger, would hold the 220 mln dlrs of debt and that thespecial preferred stock would immediately be converted intoexchangeable participating preferred of the new company.    This preferred, Resorts said, would pay a dividend based onthe net cash flows from the new companys Paradise Islandoperations.    A Resorts spokesman said the KSZ offer was made in atwopage letter and that Resorts could not comment on itbecause it did not contain enough information. Resorts hasasked Bear, Sterns to obtain complete data, he said.    The spokesman said Resorts is not familiar with KSZ butthat it believes the company is controlled by Marvin Davis, theDenver oilman.    Calls to Davis were referred to Lee Solters, who handlespublic relations for Davis. Solters, said to be travelling, wasnot immediately available for comment.    Donald Trump was also unavailable for comment, as was aspokesman for the Crosby estate."

Volcker told committee chairman Fernand St. Germain aproposal to deny primary dealer status to firms from countriesthat do not grant U.S. firms equal access to their governmentdebt markets might invite retaliation against U.S. firmsabroad.    He added, even Japan, against whom this proposal seems tobe particularly directed, has started opening its markets.    In his letter, made available at the Treasury, Volcker alsosaid a proposal to ease debt problems of developing countriesby setting up a public facility to buy their debts owed tocommercial banks, was a problem.    I believe that the prospect of debt relief would underminethe difficult internal efforts of the borrowing countries toachieve the structural reform that is needed regardless of thepolicies that are followed on servicing external debt, Volckersaid.    It might also cause private lenders to become reluctant toextend more credit to the borrowing countries, he said.    Volcker said he endorsed comments by Treasury SecretaryJames Baker about the inappropriateness of using publicresources for purchasing private commercial bank debt, which weboth see as an inherent aspect of the proposed internationaldebt facility.    He also said a proposal for establishing formal proceduresfor international negotiations on currency exchange rates isunrealistic and could well have damaging effects.    For example, the bills directive to intitiate negotiationsin order to achieve a competitive exchange rate for the dollar a matter upon which there can be considerable differenceamong analysts  runs the risk of building up potentiallydestabilizing market expectations, Volcker said.    He recommended we should not lock ourselves into formalizedprocedures for international negotiations on exchange rates butinstead use other, more flexible means like the recent mmetingin Paris between U.S. treasury and central bank representativesand those of major trade allies."

  "body": "U.S. corn acreage this year is likely to drop to the lowest level since the unsurpassedacreage reductions of the 1983 PIK year and could rank as oneof the lowest corn plantings in the United States in sixtyyears, Agriculture Department officials said.    USDA releases its official plantings report on March 31.Agriculture Department analysts said next weeks figures willlikely show a sharp drop in acreage to as low as 65 mln acres,down 22 pct from last years plantings of 83.3 mln acres.    Assuming an 18 mln acre drop in plantings, U.S. cornproduction will also decrease significantly. Analysts said 1987corn production could drop by over one billion bushels toaround seven billion bushels.    Expected signup of up to 90 pct in the 1987 feed grainsprogram, along with 1.9 mln acres enrolled in the conservationprogram, will cause acreage to plummet, Department feedgrainanalysts said.    Theres no question that there will be a sharp decrease incorn acreage, one said. Its difficult for any farmer to notgo along with the program this year.    Soybean acreage is also expected to decline this year butat a much slower rate of around four pct, USDA analysts said.    Soybean plantings could drop to 59 mln acres or below, theysaid, compared to last years level of 61.5 mln acres.    If analysts unofficial estimates prove correct then thedrop in u.s. corn acreage will be the largest since 1983 whenfarmers idled 22 mln acres in the PaymentInKind program.    Farmers planted only around 60 mln acres of corn in 1983. Asevere drought that summer in major producing states causedyields to tumble and final crop production to total only 4.2billion bushels.    Given normal weather conditions this year, USDA analystssaid the 1987 corn crop could end up around seven billionbushels, down from last years crop of 8.3 billion bushels.    This kind of acreage reduction will mean a significantreduction in production, an analyst said.    A crop of seven billion bushels is close to the annual U.S.corn usage, so surplus stocks, while not decreasing, would notincrease significantly, a specialist said.    High producing corn belt states are expected to show thegreatest acreage reductions, based upon historicalparticipation in government programs, analysts said.    In contrast, soybean acreage is likely to be cut the mostin marginal producing areas of the southeast and the westerncorn belt, a USDA soybean analyst said.    Soybean acreage in the eastern corn belt will not budge,he said. Neither does he expect any significant acreage cuts inhigherproducing delta areas.    Soybean production could drop fractionally from last years2.0 billion bushels to 1.8 to 1.9 billion, he said.    U.S. soybean acreage, after soaring to 71.4 mln acres in1979 from only 52 mln acres five years prior to that, hassteadily declined in the 1980s.    U.S. corn acreage, with the exception of 1983, has been inthe low to mid 80mln acre range for the past 10 years. Thehighest corn plantings reported in the 60 years that USDA haskept such records was in 1932 when farmers planted 113 mlnacres and obtained average yields of 26.5 bushels per acre.    Last year U.S. farmers obtained record corn yieldsaveraging 119.3 bushels per acre.    We have absolutely no trouble producing an eight billionbushel crop on only 80 mln acres or so, an analyst said.    Corn acreage will probably level at around 65 mln acres aslong as government program provisions remain the same, analystssaid.    Currently farmers enrolling in the program are required toset aside 20 pct of their base acreage and then are eligiblefor payments of two dlrs per bushel by idling an additional 15pct of their acreage.    To get to the PIK level of 60 mln acres, we would have toprovide more incentives, an analyst said."

  "title": "U.S. SUGAR QUOTA MAY BE EASED, CONGRESSMAN SAYS",
  "body": "The United States may soon ease its1987 sugar import quota of one mln short tons by bringingforward to the third quarter some shipments scheduled for thefourth quarter of 1987, Jerry Huckaby, a leading Congressmanrepresenting sugar growers told Reuters in an interview.    Huckaby, a Louisiana Democrat and chairman of the Housesubcommittee which deals with the sugar program, indicated theeasing of the quota might be a way to calm the concern aboutthe impact of the severe cut in U.S. sugar imports this year.    With imports coming down from 1.8 mln last year to onemln, there is legitimate concern about the impacts on Caribbeancountries and the Philippines, Huckaby said.    By bringing forward to the third quarter some imports, thequota would effectively be eased by about 250,000 tons.    Huckaby said by simply bringing forward to the thirdquarter of the year sugar imports scheduled for the Septemberto December period we could get away without having toincrease the quota.    He noted that some in the sugar industry believe anincrease in the quota is justified.    Earlier this month, representatives of U.S. cane sugarrefiners met with U.S. Agriculture Department officials torequest a quota increase of at least 200,000 tons. The refinerssaid the increase is needed because the quota is so restrictivethere could be some spot shortages of sugar in the U.S laterthis year, a refiner spokesman said.    However, the official slaid the USDA replied only that itwould consider the request.    Following the refiners request, representatives of theFlorida sugarcane producers met with USDA to express oppositionto any quota expansion, industry sources said.    The statement by Huckaby, who as a representative from asugar growing district in Louisiana is a leading architect ofthe current sugar program, indicates at least some growerofficials are concerned enough to support an easing of theimport quota, industry officials said.    Any final decision on easing the quota must be made by theReagan administrations interagency sugar policy group.    Asked about possible quota changes, A USDA official saidAs far as I know, changing the quota volume or the quota yearis not under active consideration."

  "body": "External Affairs Minister Joe Clarktoday vowed to do everything possible to fight the U.S. actionagainst Canadian potash exports, but also warned againstraising the alarm too early in the dispute.    In the latest flashpoint in CanadianU.S. trade relations,the U.S. International Trade Commission ruled unanimouslyMonday that Canadian potash shipments valued at 270 millionU.S. dlrs last year were injuring the U.S. industry.    We certainly intend to do everything we can to insure thatCanadian interests are well protected, Clark told the House ofCommons in the daily question period.    But he said the opposition parties should be careful notto raise false alarms too early.    The case now goes before the U.S. Commerce Departmentstrade division to determine if a duty should be imposed. Potashproducers from New Mexico, claiming unfair governmentsubsidies, are seeking a 43 pct tariff on Canadas shipments.    Canada, the worlds largest potash producer, exported 9.8mln metric tonnes of potash last year, with nearly a thirdgoing to the U.S.    Most of the potash, used in the production of fertilizer,comes from provincially owned mines in Saskatchewan.    In the Commons, Liberal member Lloyd Axworthy branded theruling as just another trade harrassment from the U.S. andcriticized Clarks assurances the countrys interests would beprotected.    We received exactly the same kind of assurances in thesoftwood lumber case that was totally fumbled and bumbled,Axworthy said.    Canadas Progressive Conservative government agreed toimpose a 15 pct duty on its softwood lumber exports earlierthis year to end a long and bitter bilateral trade dispute withthe U.S.    Axworthy urged the government to present Canadas case toworld trade authorities under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.    But Clark maintained the potash dispute was another exampleof why Canada needs to find a new way to settle bilateralirritants in the free trade negotiations under way with theU.S.    What we are seeking to do is put in place a bettersystem, Clark said.    Meanwhile, Saskatchewan Trade Minister Bob Andrew expressedconfidence Canada would win its case, claiming the problemstems from low international commodity prices and notgovernment subsidies.    The reality of the problem and the injury is causedworldwide, he said. Its caused by a downturn in thecommodity price for fertilizer, whether its potash fertilizer,nitrogen fertilizer or whatever."

  "title": "MERGERS, PUBLIC OFFERS SEEN AMONG CAR DEALERS",
  "body": "Automobile dealerships have becomelarge, multistore operations, and the largest sell more than 1billion dlrs a year worth of vehicles a year.    Around the auto industry there is talk of mergers andbuyouts among dealerships, and there are rumors that thelargest are considering offering shares to the public, analystssay.    Retail car sales are at a point of transition. Theres notmuch thats off the table in terms of creative thinking aboutways to sell cars, says David Cole, analyst with the Universityof Michigans Transportation Research Institute.    The retail car market is much more freeform now than itwas in 1956, the year things began to change, says Detroitanalyst Arvid Jauppi of Arvid Jauppi and Associates.    Thirty years ago, in 1956, the situation was different.Dealerships sold one kind of cara Chevy or a Ford or aStudebaker. The average dealer had 17 employees and sold738,000 dlrs worth of vehicles, according to the NationalAutomobile Dealers Association.    That year a tiny car from overseasGermanys VolkswagenBeatlebegan to gain popularity. The Bug caused arebellion among dealers, who demanded greater freedom fromrestrictions placed on them by the major American automakers,says Jauppi.    One of the most visible changes in retail car sales hasbeen in the size of dealerships, auto analysts say. Last year,the average dealership had 11.2 mln dlrs in salesa 15foldincrease from 1956and employed 34 workers.    I had one of these guys tell me he makes six, seven mlndlrs a year and didnt know what to do with all his money,says Cole.    Theres a whole lot more rich guys who sell cars than thatmake cars, he says.    With the increase in size, large dealers have been buyingup other dealerships, and auto analysts see few signs the trendwill let up.    Donald Keithley, vice president, dealer services, for J.D.Power, a Californiabased market research firm, says that, by1990, 12,000 people will own dealerships compared to 16,800principal owners today.    Many dealers are experimenting with owning severalfranchises, some of which might compete against each other. Itused to be a Chevrolet dealer was a Chevrolet dealer. Now aChevrolet dealer might handle several lines, Jauppi says.    As dealers get bigger, industry officials are talking aboutthe possibility that some of them might become publiclyownedor open international operations.    Offering shares to the public is an option large dealers,are obviously thinking of very seriously, says Cole.    Although some say the franchise system might get in the wayof a public offering, Jauppi says there are few obstacles totrading in car dealer shares.    Dealers are large enough now to go public. The only thingthe manufacturer cares about is that the dealer sells thosecars. It could happen any time, Jauppi says.    If you look at the whole merger mania, and look at thescale some of these dealers, its going to be very hard toresist taking them public, said another analyst.    And Jauppi says that dealerships can be expected to becomeinternational.    Were going to have international dealersdealer networksthat are worldwide, he says. U.S. dealers will be attractedparticularly to Europe, where the market will expand fasterthan the U.S., he says.    Its not totally off the wall, says Cole."

Speaking after talks with the committee here, Gros alsosaid he did not expect to make interest payment to the banks atthis moment.    He added that no one should expect any dramaticdevelopments before March 31.    Brazil last month suspended interest payments on its 68billion dlrs debt to commercial banks and froze shorttermtrade and money market lines.    Bankers said they would relay the Brazilian request for anextension but declined to say whether they were specificallyendorsing it.    Gros said the decision, which he called a standstillarrangement, will be communicated to Brazils 700 bankcreditors by telex tomorrow. Banks had been pressing Brazil tomake at least a token interest payment, but Gros said thegovernment was unable to comply for the moment.    He stressed however that Brazil was willing to pay as soonas it could, but added that a payment of interest was notconnected with the extension of the credit lines.    That would not be wise, he said.    He said that the extension of the shortterm lines wouldnot be carried out through an official instrument as there wasnot time to complete the legal requirements.    Gros said Brazil was likely to meet again with the 14bankadvisory committee once Brazil had information to present on aneconomic plan. REUTER3"

The analysts also said they expect Jardine Matheson to paya total dividend of 15 to 20 cents a share against 10 cents ashare in 1985.    James Capel Far East Ltd estimates Jardine Mathesons1986 profits at 450 mln dlrs and attributes most of the incometo retail sales.    Analysts said the groups 7Eleven retail stores and itsfranchises, among them Canon cameras, Christian Dior luxurygoods and Mercedes Benz cars, produced a strong cash flow.    Alan Hargreaves of Hoare Govett Asia Ltd also put JardineMathesons 1986 net profits at 450 mln dlrs and said heestimates pretax earnings from retail operations at about 465mln dlrs against 339 mln in 1985.    But Hargreaves said Jardine Mathesons earnings from its 35pct stake in Hong Kong Land Co Ltd HKLD.HKG will fall toabout 230 mln dlrs from 281 mln dlrs in 1985.    The reduced contribution reflects the spinoff from HongKong Land of Dairy Farm International Ltd last September.    Jardine gained a direct holding of 35 pct of Dairy Farm asa result of the spinoff. Analysts said Jardine will bookrevenues from its Dairy Farm stake for the final months of theyear as part of its retail business, which will increase itsoverall retail income figures.    Analysts said Jardine Matheson will also enjoy sharplyincreased revenues from financial services, mainly its 50 pctshare of Jardine Fleming Holdings Ltd.    Jardine Fleming yesterday reported record profits for 1986of 209.5 mln dlrs against 104.7 mln in 1985.    Analysts said Jardine Matheson made net interest paymentsof about 200 mln dlrs last year, slightly below the 213 mlndlrs of 1985, while the companys term debt remained at aboutthe 1985 level of 2.7 billion dlrs.    But Jardine was also subject to increased taxes of 340 mlndlrs last year against 292 mln in 1985, they said.    Jardine Matheson is undergoing a series of reorganisationsthat will in effect turn it into a holding company for itsdiverse interests.    It previously announced a plan to sell its stakes in bothHong Kong Land and Dairy Farm to newly created JardineStrategic Holdings Ltd in which it has a 41 pct interest.    A company statement issued last month said the firm willuse the proceeds to repay all debt, leaving it with anadditional 500 mln dlrs in cash on hand.    Though Jardine Matheson will be deprived of a direct stakein the highyield Hong Kong Land and Dairy Farm units, it islikely to develop its own business, analysts said.    The future of the stock will depend on the firms abilityto creatively structure some new acquisitions, said Hargreavesof Hoare Govett.    He noted the firm has suggested financial services as a keysector, and he said it may add some insurance firms to itsexisting business. REUTER3"

  "body": "Chinas first joint venture bank, XiamenInternational Bank XIB, reported a group net profit of about14 mln Hong Kong dlrs in 1986, the banks first full year ofoperation.    General manager Liu Shuxun declined to give a 1987 profitforecast, saying targets were under study.    Assistant general manager Wang Hongshan said the groupsoutstanding loans at end1986 totalled 620 mln Hong Kong dlrs,up from 530 mln at end1985. Deposits and interbank borrowingsrose to 680 mln dlrs from 550 mln, he told Reuters.    Liu said most of the groups profit came from the parentcompany rather than its two whollyowned subsidiaries XiamenInternational Finance Co Ltd in Hong Kong and LusoInternational Bank Ltd in Macao.    The joint venture bank began operating in September 1985but did not officially open until March 1986.    Liu said the share in the joint venture of the foreignpartner, Hong Konglisted Panin Holdings Ltd, had been cutlast year to 49 pct from 60 pct. This was done because foreignbanks felt the XIBs reputation would be improved if the threeChinese partners collectively held a majority stake, he said.    Liu said news reports about problems concerning Panin wereunfounded, but he did not elaborate. Panin Holdings reported aloss of 1.99 mln Hong Kong dlrs in 1986 after a net profit of268,000 dlrs in 1985.    The Chinese partners are Industrial and Commercial Bank ofChina, Fujian branch, whose share rose to 23.5 pct from 15,Fujian Investment and Enterprise Corporation 17.5 pct 15 andXiamen Construction and Development Corporation 10 pct 10.    One foreign banker said Xiamen International Bank faced thesame problems as foreign bank branches in trying to compete onunequal terms with stateowned banks.    The foreign banking market in Xiamen is thin and almostsaturated, he added.    Officials of the joint venture bank said they benefittedfrom contacts made through its three Chinese partners. But theforeign banker, who asked not to be named, said it facedinternal competition from the Industrial and Commercial Bank.    Apart from Xiamen International Bank and the InternationalAgricultural Development Bank planned by the World Bank and thestateowned Agricultural Bank of China, Xiamen has eightforeign bank branches or representative offices, mostly of HongKong or overseas Chinese banks.

  "body": "The yen could rise to 140 yen to thedollar, a leading Japanese businessman said.    Bumpei Otsuki, president of the influential JapanFederation of Employers Associations, Nikkeiren, toldreporters The yen might rise as far as 140 to the dollar.The U.S. Economy is not good, and as long as the U.S. Economyis not good, the U.S. Will put various pressures on Japan.    The yens level depends on the condition of the U.S.Economy rather than Japans economy, and as long as theAmerican situation is bad, the yen will continue to rise, hesaid.    To cope with the negative impact of the strong yen,Japanese enterprises must strive to cut costs by all means,including holding down wages as much as possible, Otsuki said.    He rejected recent calls from some government quarters forwage increases this year as a means of raising privateconsumption and thus boosting domestic demand.    We have to keep wages as low as possible, he said.    He also said the yens large and rapid rise is depressingthe outlook for the Japanese economy, noting that in additionto hurting exporters it is also damaging domestic marketmanufacturers through cheap imports.    Parts of the service sector are also threatened, Otsukisaid.    Tertiary industries provide services to manufacturers and adownturn in manufacturing profits will adversely affect serviceindustries, he said.    It is also doubtful whether the tertiary sector can fullyemploy those put out of work in the manufacturing sector, hesaid.    Profits of service sector companies are likely to fall inthe business year ending in March 1988, leading to a possiblerecession in the Japanese economy, he said.    Otsuki said economic growth is unlikely to pick up beyondlevels experienced in 1986.    The governments Economic Planning Agency said last weekthe economy grew at 2.5 pct in 1986, the worst performancesince 1974 when the economy shrank 1.4 pct due to the first oilprice crisis.    In order to stimulate domestic demand and boost theeconomy, tax reforms aimed at bringing down the cost of landand reforming the nations housing stock are needed, along withsteps to bring down the high cost of commodities, he said.

He told a conference organised by the Development Bank ofSingapore Ltd that Singapore wants to develop the fixed ratesecurities market. He said a state securities market, along thesame lines as the U.S. Government securities market, will bedeveloped to provide a benchmark for corporate bonds.    Teo said the fixed rate securities market will pave the wayfor companies to raise fixed rate funds.    Referring to a proposed change in the broking commissionstructure, Teo said the exchange is likely to introduce asliding scale structure instead of a negotiated commissionstructure. He said the negotiated structure works against smallinvestors, who play an important role in the market.

But Belgian Research Minister Guy Verhofstadt toldreporters the two had been given just over a week to end theiropposition or risk plunging EC research into a crisis.    The socalled Framework Program proposed by the ECsExecutive Commission was designed to boost research in areassuch as computers, biotechnology and telecommunications andcombat U.S. And Japanese domination in these fields.    The fiveyear program was due to start at the beginning ofthis year, but was delayed by calls from Britain, France andWest Germany for cuts in the proposed budget of 7.7 billionEuropean Currency Units Ecus, diplomats said.    The EC Commission had already cut the budget from 10.5billion Ecus, but under EC law the program needs the approvalof all member states before it can be launched.    France has withdrawn its objections and backed a newcompromise budget proposed by Verhofstadt to trim spending.    But Britain is continuing its demands for further, sharpcuts in the budget.    West Germany, which yesterday appeared to be ready toaccept the compromise, was also holding back.    Verhofstadt, who chaired the lengthy meeting, said he hadgiven the two states until April 3 to withdraw theiropposition.    But if one or both failed to do so, the EC would be leftwithout a research program, leaving no money for schemes suchas the ECs Esprit information technology drive.    If that happened ... There would be a grave crisis inEuropes scientific and research policy, Verhofstadt said,adding it could mean research teams being disbanded.    Diplomats said West Germany was close to agreeing to thecompromise, which would limit new spending to 5.4 billion Ecusby allowing for cash already set aside for future projects.    The plan would also set aside at least 16 pct of the 5.4billion Ecus for spending after the end of the fiveyearprogram, they said. But Britain still maintained theallocations were much too high.    Britains Research Minister Geoffrey Pattie faced a toughfight to convince his government colleagues they should acceptan increase in spending beyond the 4.2 billion Ecu level so fardemanded by Britain, one diplomat added.

An Importers Association official said that even if theDepartment no longer imports sugar, we would not necessarilybuy more.    This is because the Association would still have to competewith the Cooperatives Wholesale Establishment CWE, he said.    The CWE is a semigovernment body and the official saidarrangements are being made for state cooperatives and holdersof food subsidy stamps to draw their sugar from it, startingApril 1.    Ministry officials said the CWE can either import sugar orbuy it from a local bonded warehousing scheme run by E.D.F. Forthe past two years. REUTER3"

  "title": "MIDDLE EAST CURRENCY MARKET SEES KEY CHANGES",
  "body": "Middle East currency dealers meet inAbu Dhabi this weekend at a time of fundamental change in theirbusiness, which has seen a growing volume of trade shift fromthe Arab world to London.    The 14th congress of the InterArab Cambiste Associationalso comes at a time when the prospect of a unified Gulfcurrency system is more real that at any time this decade.    Foreign exchange traders and bank treasurers said theseissues, and the slide of the Lebanese pound, can be expected tobe major talking points.    About 250 traders and treasurers from some 115 banks including some in London and other major nonArab financialcentres  are expected to attend the conference which beginson on Saturday.    Bankers said it is hard to avoid the impression that agrowing proportion of transactions in the Saudi riyal market,by far the largest in the region, is being carried out inLondon.    The market had been dominated by Saudi Arabias 11 banks,foreign exchange houses in the Kingdom and offshore banks inBahrain. But bankers said more and more Saudi and Bahrainbasedbanks are boosting their treasury operations in London.    As recession hit the Middle East and the need for tradefinance in the region declined, many offshore banks in Bahrainran down their currency operations. None of the four major U.K.Clearing banks now has a dealing room on the island.    The two major Bahrainbased international banks, ArabBanking Corp and Gulf International Bank BSC have increasedtheir presence in London and Saudi banks are busy upgradingrepresentative offices to branch status to allow dealing.    One economist said It is cheaper to run a riyal book inLondon than staff an expensive offshore operation in Bahrain...There is now the nucleus of a twoway market in London.    Jeddahbased Riyad Bank set up as a licensed deposittaker in London in 1984, while its main rival in Saudi Arabia,National Commercial Bank NCB won a licence in November1986.    The major market maker has traditionally been Londonbasedconsortium bank Saudi International Bank but the kingdomjointventure Saudi American Bank SAMBA also upgraded itsLondon operation to deposit taker status in midFebruary.    One senior currency trader in Riyadh said Inevitably thevolume of business in London has gained pace with the two newlicences for NCB and SAMBA, but there is no question that mostof the liquidity still rests in Saudi Arabia.    Currency traders said the shift to London in the Saudiriyal market is difficult to quantify.    Bahrain Monetary Agency figures show regional currencydeposits held by offshore banks, most in Saudi riyals, droppedto the equivalent of 12.2 billion dlrs at endSeptember 1986from 13.4 billion at end1985 and a 1983 peak of 15.0 billion.    The shift has prompted changes in dealing habits. Riyaltrading in the Gulf on Saturdays and Sundays has become veryquiet with London closed while some Saudi and Bahrain banks nowstaff offices on Friday, the Gulf weekend. Traders also expectArab National Bank to step up London operations.    Traders say it is difficult to foresee the riyal marketmoving completely out of the region, partly because of localdemand and partly because of what is seen as the Saudi ArabianMonetary Agencys SAMA desire to moderateinternationalisation of the riyal and protect it from unduespeculation.    There have been far fewer signs of the Kuwaiti dinar marketshifting from its natural base of Kuwait and trading in Bahrainand London is still limited.    But for the first time since the formation of the sixnation Gulf Cooperation Council GCC in 1981 there are signsthat a much mooted currency union could come into force soon.    Currency traders said it remains unclear what form a finalcurrency union would take for the six states  Saudi Arabia,Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.    But plans to link the six currencies in a European MonetarySystem style with a common peg have been discussed at highlevel and could be a topic on the GCCs annual summit expectedto be held in Saudi Arabia late in the year.    One dealer said A lot of exposure is being given todiscussions and plans appear to be quite advanced. But in theend a political decision has to be taken to give the goahead.    One open question is that of a common peg for currencies.    The idea of linking the six currencies has been debatedsince the start of the GCC. The Kuwaiti dinar is currentlylinked to a basket of currencies while the other fivecurrencies are either officially or in practice linked to theU.S. Dollar.    Some traders said a currency union could mean speculationagainst the Saudi riyal rubbing off on other Gulf currencies,but plans call for a permitted divergence in the system of714 pct, large enough to avoid sudden strains.    Another topic for debate is expected to be the continuedslide of the Lebanese pound against the dollar and theundermining of the effective capital base of Lebanese banks. REUTER3"

  "body": "Malaysias net external borrowingsfor 1987 are expected to be maintained at around last yearslevels of about 1.45 billion ringgit, Zain Azraai, secretarygeneral to the Finance Ministry, told an investment seminarhere.    Malaysias debt service ratio will also be maintained at alevel no higher than 20 pct, he said. This is well within thecapacity of the nation to service.    Azraai said the 1986 foreign borrowing level and projectedestimates of 1987 compared favourably with the peak of around5.5 billion ringgit in 1982.    Malaysias external debts total 48 to 49 billion ringgitand its debt service ratio exceeds 20 pct, the Development Bankof Singapore Ltd, one of Singapores four major local banks,said in a report released this week.    Azraai said While the growth in debt has been rapid inrecent years, it is still within the limits of prudence andconscious efforts have been made and will continue to be madeto decelerate and restrain external borrowings.    He said the Malaysian government is urgently addressing thetwin deficits of the Federal Budget and the balance of paymentswhich followed two recessions in the 1980s.    Azraai said Malaysias public sector deficit had risen dueto the contraction in the governments resources as well as therapid growth in public expenditures.    With declining incomes and export earnings, the bases forresource generation became limited, and the government will notraise taxes because current tax margins are high compared toMalaysias neighbours, he said.    As such the remaining avenue for rationalising andconsolidating the budget is through expenditure reductions, hesaid.    Azraai said the Malaysian governments developmentexpenditures were cut by about 25 pct in 1987, while those ofstate enterprises were reduced by 41 pct.    He said A commitment has been undertaken to reduce thebudget deficit over time and to balance the Federalgovernments budget current account deficit by 1989.    Malaysian Finance Minister Daim Zainuddin presented abudget for 1987 which foresees a deficit of 9.4 billionringgit, down from 11.6 billion in 1986, with federal spendingtargetted at 27.4 billion, down from 30.8 billion, and revenueat 18 billion against 19.2 billion.    Azraai said the government will cut the size of the publicsector and privatize those operations which may be better runby the private sector. New measures have been introduced toboost the private sector and attract foreign investment.    A higher proportion of foreign ownership, even up to 100pct, is now possible for new investments in the manufacturingsector made between October 1986 and December 1990, he said.    The long term prospects of the Malaysian economy are bright... Indications are already available to show that the economyis recovering and that growth will be positive and strongerthan originally expected, Azraai said. REUTER3"

  "body": "China must cut excess demand and capitalinvestment in the face of budget and foreign exchange deficitsbut will press ahead with wideranging economic reforms in1987, Premier Zhao Ziyang told parliament.    Zhao told the annual meeting of the National PeoplesCongress that while China cooled its overheated economy, cutits trade deficit and raised national living standards in 1986,serious imbalances remain.    Zhao said total social demand exceeds total supply, anddemand for consumer goods, especially from state firms, is toohigh. They squander public funds to a serious extent ... andissue excessive wage and bonus increases, he said.    Failure to cut this excess will result in reducedaccumulation of funds...And serve to corrupt social morality,Zhao said. He said there was a contradiction between low percapita incomes and excessively high consumer demand.    China needs to accumulate enormous funds for constructionin its initial stage of socialist modernisation and consumptionmust match the available resources, he said.    Zhao said there was a deficit in state finances in 1986because of the sharp fall in world oil prices, the rising costof foreign exchange earnings through exports, reduced incomefrom customs duties and unreasonably heavy spending.    Local authorities, departments and firms have been able toretain more revenue since economic reforms in 1979. Theyunjustifiably developed processing industries andnonproductive construction, Zhao said.    He said that unless effective measures are taken to curbthis practice, financial and credit deficits are likely toincrease in the next few years.    Zhao said that if such deficits become excessive and lasttoo long, they will cause the overissue of money, which inturn will cause disturbing inflation, a precipitous rise incommodity prices and chaos in economic life.    Another serious problem is that too many new constructionprojects have been launched. Fixed asset investment outside thestate plan is overextended and the pattern of such investmentis highly irrational, he said.    Investment in energy, transport, telecommunications and rawand semifinished materials industries is inadequate andinvestment in nonproductive projects is too large, he said.     Zhao said some departments and local authorities havefailed to take prompt and effective measures to correct thisinvestment imbalance, despite instructions to do so from theState Council earlier this year.     He said Chinas per capita output of grain and other farmand sideline products is still very low and production ofgrain, forestry, animal husbandry and fisheries rests on arather weak foundation.     Chinas countryside is still in the development stage andthere is vast potential to be tapped through deep reforms, hesaid, but did not elaborate.    Zhao said the main task for reform in 1987 is to breathelife into Chinas large and medium sized state firms, whichstill do not have a satisfactory combination ofresponsibilities, powers and benefits.    We have yet to create conditions for giving the enterprisesfull managerial authority and full responsibility for their ownprofits and losses, he said.    Currently, the firms are not responding rationally tomarket changes and doing all the state requires of them, hesaid. Their potential is not being fully tapped, he added.    Zhao said that in 1987, China will speed up the reform ofits financial system, diversify credit services, encouragecompetition among different financial institutions and promoteinsurance services.    He said the system of bank interest rates must be reformed,with differential and floating rates being applied fordifferent periods of time.    China must, under proper guidance, develop markets for thecirculation of funds in major cities and exploit the role offinancial markets in pooling and regulating funds, he added.    Zhao said China must also expand the market for capitalgoods such as rolled steel, coal, cement and timber. The lackof such a market is the main reason why large state firms haveyet to be fully invigorated, he said.    He also promised a continuation of the labour contractsystem under which all firms hire workers for a fixed periodand pay them according to their own methods, subject only tostateset ceilings for wages and bonuses.

  "title": "MIXED ASIAN REACTION TO NEW RUBBER PACT",
  "body": "Governments of major Asianproducing countries have welcomed the conclusion of a newInternational Natural Rubber Agreement INRA, but growers andtraders are unhappy with the development, according to viewspolled by Reuter correspondents.    Officials in Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand, whichproduce the bulk of the worlds rubber, said they expected thenew pact to continue to stabilise prices and help their rubberindustries remain viable in the longterm.    But traders and growers said they were against the new pactbecause its buffer stock mechanism was likely to intereferewith free market forces and prevent sharp rubber price rises.    The new INRA, to replace the current one which expires onOctober 22, was formally adopted by most of the worldsproducers and consumers in Geneva last Friday.    It will be open for signature at the U.N. Headquarters inNew York from May 1 to December 31 this year and will enterinto force provisionally when ratified by countries accountingfor 75 pct of world rubber exports and 75 pct of world imports.    Malaysian Primary Industries Minister Lim Keng Yaik saidthe formal adoption of a new pact had dispelled fears ofliquidation of some 360,000 tonnes of INRA buffer stock rubberand a possible depression of prices.    He expressed confidence that the new INRA would continue tokeep prices stable by selling or buying rubber as prices roseor fell through its buffer stock system.    Malaysia was also happy that in the new INRA financing ofpurchases for the normal buffer stock of 400,000 tonnes and acontingency buffer stock of 150,000 tonnes would be donethrough direct cash contributions from members, he said.    Under the existing pact, members can borrow from banks tofinance INRAs buffer stock purchases. This has been viewedwith concern by some members who fear the INRA may becomeindebted and ultimately face collapse, like the InternationalTin Agreement.    This will ensure the buffer stock operation is carried outwithout any financial encumbrance, Lim said.     Malaysia, the worlds largest producer, was seekingcabinet approval to join the new INRA and hoped other producersand consumers would also become members, he said.    Officials in Jakarta said the new pact would bring benefitto Indonesias rubber industrys by stabilising prices.    It was unlikely to collapse like the tin agreement becauseits new financial provisions had been tightened, they said.    Thai officials told Reuters they were optimistic the newpact was viable because it strictly limited the extent of debtthe INRA buffer stock manager might commit to his marketoperations.     Malaysian growers, however, said they preferred a freerubber market because an INRA had a tendency to keep prices atlevels that were only acceptable to consumers.    With the INRAs ability to keep prices at a certain stablelevel, consumers are assured of rubber at almost a fixed price,while producers may never see sharp price rises, a MalaysianRubber Producers Council source told Reuters.    Producers also wanted a free rubber market without theoverhang of a 360,000 tonne INRA buffer stock which hadpsychologically prevented price rises, he said.    State plantation officials in Sri Lanka said prices hadbeen depressed since INRAs inception and the creation of abuffer stock, and they seemed unlikely to rise.    Sri Lanka should not be a member of the INRA because it wasexpensive to maintain a buffer stock, they added.    Traders in the region, meanwhile, said prices might bepressured by the new pact in the long term as its potential tostabilise prices and buffer stock capacity would spur producersto produce more.    Most Malaysian and Singapore traders said the new pactsconclusion had little impact on prices and it was unlikely toallow sharp price fluctuations in future.    The 360,000 tonnes in the INRA buffer stock must beliquidated and a free market returned, a Malaysian trader said.    Japanese traders said the new pact had a chance for successas most world producers and consumers had adopted it, but theyquestioned the ability of some financiallystrapped producersto finance buffer stock operations.

SwireProperties expects further good results both from propertiesunder development for sale and from its investment propertyportfolio.    He did not give any specific projections for earnings. Thecompany earlier reported 46 pct higher 1986 net profits at 1.78billion H.K. Dlrs from a year ago.    Swire also had an extraordinary profit of 1.38 billion dlrsmainly from the sale of a 15.25 pct interest in Cathay PacificAirways Ltd CAPH.HKG.    Miles said the company will use the money to develop itsbusiness, primarily in Hong Kong.    Swires stake in Cathay was first reduced to 54.25 pct from70 pct when Cathay was publicly floated, and then cut to 50.25pct when Cathay issued new shares amounting to 12 pct of theenlarged capital to the stateowned China International Trustand Investment Corp. Cathay last week reported its 1986profits rose to 1.23 billion dlrs from 777 mln a year ago.    Miles said despite last years rapid expansion in Cathaysflights and fleet, load factor is still holding up at 70 pct.    He said Cathays growth last year was the result of amarginal increase in the revenue load factor coupled withsavings in fuel costs.    At present fuel prices are stable and will remain stablefor the rest of this year, he said, though there might be a bitof increase later this year.    Miles said Swire is not abandoning its offshore oil serviceoperations, even though the marine sector is generallydepressed. Obviously the marine industry is not getting anybetter, he said.

  "body": "The Bank of Thailand is seeking FinanceMinistry approval to issue its first bond, central bank sourcessaid.    The planned three billion baht issue would carry a term ofsix months to one year as a short term move to mop up surplusfunds held by commercial banks.    The issue would offer a coupon attractive to commercialbanks, which currently have an estimated 30 to 60 billion bahtin funds invested in lowyield securities, the sources said.    The central bank, charged with supervision of commercialbanks, has previously issued only Finance Ministry bonds.    Private bankers said they are awaiting a central bankdecision on whether to allow commercial banks to continueholding up to 40 pct of their capital in foreign exchange or toreturn it to 20 pct as scheduled.    The six month 40 pct ceiling expires April 6 but the bankswant it extended for six more months.    They said a forced cut in foreign exchange positions wouldworsen the local liquidity problem as commercial banks wouldhave to convert about five billion baht worth of foreigncurrencies in their portfolios into baht.    Senior central bank officials suggested to reporters lastweek that the foreign exchange ceiling will be lowered todiscourage banks use of excess funds for currency speculation.    Central bank sources said some commercial banks,anticipating such a central bank decision, have been convertingtheir foreign currencies into baht this week and lending theadditional funds to the Bank of Thailands shortterm loanrepurchase facility.    They said the Bank of Thailands repurchase windowyesterday received offers of about three billion baht ofinvestment funds from commercial banks, three times its normaldaily amount.    The repurchase window uses government bonds as aninstrument with which commercial banks can borrow from or lendto the state bank.    The facility is sometimes used by the central bank to set alocal shortterm interest benchmark through fixing its bondrepurchase rates. REUTER3"

  "title": "YEN MAY RISE TO 140 TO THE DLR, NIKKEIREN SAYS",
  "body": "The yen could rise to 140 yen to thedollar, a leading Japanese businessman said.    Bumpei Otsuki, president of the influential JapanFederation of Employers Associations, Nikkeiren, toldreporters The yen might rise as far as 140 to the dollar.The U.S. Economy is not good, and as long as the U.S. Economyis not good, the U.S. Will put various pressures on Japan.    The yens level depends on the condition of the U.S.Economy rather than Japans economy, and as long as theAmerican situation is bad, the yen will continue to rise, hesaid.    To cope with the negative impact of the strong yen,Japanese enterprises must strive to cut costs by all means,including holding down wages as much as possible, Otsuki said.    He rejected recent calls from some government quarters forwage increases this year as a means of raising privateconsumption and thus boosting domestic demand.    We have to keep wages as low as possible, he said.    He also said the yens large and rapid rise is depressingthe outlook for the Japanese economy, noting that in additionto hurting exporters it is also damaging domestic marketmanufacturers through cheap imports.    Parts of the service sector are also threatened, Otsukisaid.    Tertiary industries provide services to manufacturers and adownturn in manufacturing profits will adversely affect serviceindustries, he said.    It is also doubtful whether the tertiary sector can fullyemploy those put out of work in the manufacturing sector, hesaid.    Profits of service sector companies are likely to fall inthe business year ending in March 1988, leading to a possiblerecession in the Japanese economy, he said.    Otsuki said economic growth is unlikely to pick up beyondlevels experienced in 1986.    The governments Economic Planning Agency said last weekthe economy grew at 2.5 pct in 1986, the worst performancesince 1974 when the economy shrank 1.4 pct due to the first oilprice crisis.    In order to stimulate domestic demand and boost theeconomy, tax reforms aimed at bringing down the cost of landand reforming the nations housing stock are needed, along withsteps to bring down the high cost of commodities, he said.

Speaking after talks with the committee here, Gros alsosaid he did not expect to make interest payment to the banks atthis moment.    He added that no one should expect any dramaticdevelopments before March 31.    Brazil last month suspended interest payments on its 68billion dlrs debt to commercial banks and froze shorttermtrade and money market lines.    Bankers said they would relay the Brazilian request for anextension but declined to say whether they were specificallyendorsing it.    Gros said the decision, which he called a standstillarrangement, will be communicated to Brazils 700 bankcreditors by telex tomorrow. Banks had been pressing Brazil tomake at least a token interest payment, but Gros said thegovernment was unable to comply for the moment.    He stressed however that Brazil was willing to pay as soonas it could, but added that a payment of interest was notconnected with the extension of the credit lines.    That would not be wise, he said.    He said that the extension of the shortterm lines wouldnot be carried out through an official instrument as there wasnot time to complete the legal requirements.

  "title": "LONDON ON RISE AS TRADING CENTRE IN U.S. DEBT",
  "body": "Londons rise as a trading centre forU.S. Government debt has been spurred by the increasing use ofinterest rate swaps, which are now arranged for most new issuesin the eurobond markets, traders and analysts said.    Indeed, eurobond traders estimate that about 80 pct of allnew debt issued here last year  over 186 billion dlrs worth was part of either an interest rate or currency swap.    The U.S. Treasuries market here is swapdriven, said DavidJones, vice president at Goldman Sachs and Co international andhead of its U.S. Government bond trading desk.    It is commonplace to have trades of 100 mln dlrs or more in10years, seven years or five years, all related to an interestrate swap or hedging of a eurobond deal, Jones said at a recentconference on the U.S. Treasuries market.    Just a year or so ago, he said, trades of that size goingthrough brokers screens in London were unthinkable.    Traders said that over the past two weeks, while trading inU.S. Treasuries has been almost frozen by indecision over thedirection of interest rates, swaprelated deals have providedthe sole source of new business.    Dealers said that last week, a 260 mln dlr trade involvingtwo and 10year Treasuries was transacted on brokers screens.    The trade, they said, was swap related.    There are no firm figures on exactly how much U.S. Treasurydebt is traded here and estimates vary widely.    But Wrightson Economics, a U.S.based research firm whichdrew its data from U.S. Treasury reports, estimated that grosstransactions in U.S. Government securities in London rose to341 billion dlrs in the first nine months of 1986 alone,against 188 billion in all of 1985.    Wrightson estimates that about 20 pct of all U.S. Treasurytrading is transacted outside the U.S., With Tokyo forming thethird major centre.    And while figures are not yet available for the lastquarter, the anecdotal evidence suggests that the trendcontinued, traders say.    Richard Lacy, chief executive at Exco International, putaverage daily Treasuries trading volume in London at about 15billion dlrs. Exco recently purchased an 80 pct interest in RMJSecurities inc, one of the four major brokers in U.S.Government bonds which has offices in London, New York andTokyo.    But Dick Van Splinter, president of RMJs competitor,Fundamental Brokers Incs London operations, estimates averagedaily turnover is no more than four to five billion dlrs.    But even at the low range of estimates, Treasuries tradingvolume is at least equal to that in the U.K.s own governmentbonds, known as gilts.     Jeremy Ford, vice president at Bankers Trust InternationalLtd, explained that U.S. Treasuries are used by intermediariesin swap transactions to lock in the spread, the differencebetween the interest rate the borrower has to pay and the ratethat the counterparty is obliged to pay.    But even beyond swaprelated activity, dealers said thenature of trading in London has changed.    The interesting thing our figures show is the transition inLondon from a marketing effort to a trading effort, said LouisCrandall, an economist at Wrightson who has been collecting thedata.    Crandall said that previously, firms activities werelimited to trying to sell U.S. Securities to Europeaninvestors. Now, however, they appear increasingly willing actas principal in transactions rather than acting on behalf oftheir New York offices.    Increasingly, traders say, firms maintain separate profitand loss sheets for their London operations so that tradingdecisions can be made independently from the U.S. Headquarters.    Many of the major U.S. Firms, including Merrill Lynch andCo, Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc and Chemical Bank trade fortheir own accounts here.    Also, traders point out, the number of U.S. Firms operatingin London has increased sharply over the past year, as has thenumber of European and Asian banks which trade U.S. Governmentsecurities.    Within the past few months, NationalWestminster Bank Plcs County Bank subsidiary and Swiss BankCorp have applied to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York tobecome primary dealers in U.S. Government securities and theirLondon offices have just recently received directdealingbrokers screens.    And Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette, already a primary dealer, ispreparing to open a U.S. Treasuries trading desk in London.    Dick Van Splinter, president of Fundamental Brokers Inc,the largest of the four major government bond brokers here,said he now has 45 firms using directdealing screens, up from35 a year ago. REUTER3"

The recent successful find at Iagifu is likely to put PNGon the list of major oil exporters by the early 1990s, he toldthe Australian Petroleum Exploration Association annualconference.    Fesharaki, leader of the Energy Program at the EastWestCenter in Honolulu, Hawaii, was speaking on the AsiaPacificpetroleum outlook.    With domestic demand of around 12,000 barrels per day bpdand prospects of production of over 100,000 bpd by late 1991,PNG would become an Ecuadorlevel crude exporter, Fesharakisaid.    The Iagifu wells in the Papuan Basin have recorded the bestoil flows in more than 60 years of exploration in PNG.    The PNG governments Geological Survey in a paperdistributed at the conference estimates Iagifu reserves atabout 500 mln barrels.    PNG enjoys the most liberal tax regime in the region withno secondary taxes, Fesharaki said.    We expect a much larger oil search in Papua New Guinea, anddiscovery of much larger volumes of oil, similar in quality tolight Bass Strait crude, Fesharaki said.    There are also large pockets of high quality condensates tobe produced, notably in the Juha field near Iagifu which iscapable of producing 30,000 to 40,000 bpd, he said.    But prices should be somewhat higher than the presentlevels to justify development of the Juha field, he said.    The PNG Geological Survey paper noted there are five largeprospective but littleexplored sedimentary basins in PNG. REUTER3"

Zhao told the annual meeting of the National PeoplesCongress that while China cooled its overheated economy, cutits trade deficit and raised national living standards in 1986,serious imbalances remain.    Zhao said total social demand exceeds total supply, anddemand for consumer goods, especially from state firms, is toohigh. They squander public funds to a serious extent ... andissue excessive wage and bonus increases, he said.    Failure to cut this excess will result in reducedaccumulation of funds...And serve to corrupt social morality,Zhao said. He said there was a contradiction between low percapita incomes and excessively high consumer demand.    China needs to accumulate enormous funds for constructionin its initial stage of socialist modernisation and consumptionmust match the available resources, he said.    Zhao said there was a deficit in state finances in 1986because of the sharp fall in world oil prices, the rising costof foreign exchange earnings through exports, reduced incomefrom customs duties and unreasonably heavy spending.    Investment in energy, transport, telecommunications and rawand semifinished materials industries is inadequate andinvestment in nonproductive projects is too large, he said."

  "body": "The chances of U.K. Stocks continuingrecent rises as budget euphoria gives way to the uncertaintiesof a probable election are small, and market analysts say therewill probably be a downwards correction in the next few weeks.    The U.K. Market has managed a dizzy rise since the NewYear, with the FTSE index of 100 leading shares lifting 22.5pct since January 2 to current levels around 2050.    Over the next month or two the odds are that the index willdrop back to around 1,900, said John Goldschmidt, head ofequities research at Chase Manhattan Securities.    A five to 10 pct drop is likely. There was a six pct fallbefore the 1983 election when the Conservatives were furtherahead in the polls and the market was on a multiple of only 14instead of 18 now, noted Nick Knight of brokers James Capel.    The old adage is sell in May and go away. Thats likely toapply this year but will probably start in April, he added.    But few analysts believed a correction would spell the endof the bull run that has now lasted for some six years.    As long as corporate profits and earnings keep on growingthen the pressure for continued rises will be there. Thereseems little prospect of the growth stopping in 19871988, onesaid.    Much of the recent enthusiasm has stemmed from the belief,already virtually discounted, that the ruling Conservativeswill call an election in the next few months  probably June and sweep home to a third term in office.    Even if this does happen, however, preelection nerves arelikely to produce the traditional effect of damping down themarket until the result is clear.    Its likely there will be one or two hiccups of confidenceabout the Tories winning an overall majority, Goldschmidt said.    It would be quite out of character for the market tocontinue to sail serenely upwards right through the electionand beyond, added brokers Phillips and Drew in a recent report.    The belief that the government itself is worried about theimpact of the Alliance party disrupting the usual twocornerfight of Conservative and Labour with unpredictable results, isnot likely to give reassurance, one analyst noted.    Other factors also indicate that the market is vulnerableto a downwards correction. U.K. Stocks had ridden up partly onthe back of record rises in New York and Japan and a pause ineither suggests that London would inevitably follow suit.    There would also be little new encouragement provided bygeneral economic factors as much of the recent optimistic news,including this months half point cut in base rates to 10 pct,is already built into prices.    The economy is looking okay, but it cant support 20 pctincreases every three months indefinitely, one said.    Also, market liquidity, a powerful driving force behind therecent rises, shows signs of drying up under the pressure ofthe governments privatisation campaign.    The next few months will see cash calls for second tranchepayments on British Gas Plc BRGS.L and British Airways PlcBAB.L as well as the proposed sale of Rolls Royce Plc andthe asyet untimetabled sale of the governments 31.7 pct stakein British Petroleum Co Plc BP.L.    On top of that, there will be calls from the gilt marketeven though last weeks budget limited the projected 198788borrowing requirement to four billion stg.    We are looking for a squeeze on cash flow, and thats notincluding rights issues which have been low so far this yearand may pick up in the second quarter, Knight said."

The fiveyear bond, for Inspectorate International FinanceNV, gives investors options on two separate warrant series Aand B exercisable into participation certificates in parent andguarantor Inspectorate International AG.    The first A series carries warrants for four participationcertificates. Upon exercising the A warrants, investors alsoget two warrants for the B series.    The A exercise period runs from May 7, 1987, to August 6,1987. The exercise price is 543 Swiss francs.    Of the two B warrants, one entitles investors to purchaseone participation certificate in Inspectorate International AGand the other provides seven warrants.    Investors may pay for B participation certificates byredeeming the bond issued today. In this case, the bond, issuedin denominations of 5,000 marks, will be valued at a fixedprice of 4,200 Swiss francs, or 119.05 francs per 100 marks.    Participation certificates acquired with B warrants will bepriced at 597 francs, equalling the price of the first tranche,plus a 10 pct premium. The exercise period for the B series isfrom August 8, 1987 to May 5, 1991.    Fees for the bond total 214 pct, with 112 points forselling, and 134 for management and underwriting combined.    Investors will pay for the bond on April 8, and the bondpays annual interest on the same day. It matures on April 8,1992. The bond and warrants will be listed in Frankfurt.    If all participation share warrants are exercised, thecompany will obtain some 300 mln marks in new equity.    The construction allows Inspectorate to borrow at lowercost than a comparable convertible bond and will give theInspectorate equity through issues of participationcertificates in West Germany, a Swiss Bank Corp spokesman said.    Inspectorate requires funding to finance its purchase of a51 pct stake in Harpener AG, a diversified West German group,and other recent acquisitions. REUTER3"

  "body": "The Amsterdam Stock Exchange, engagedin a reform program to boost competitiveness, said it islaunching a modernisation drive of its operational systems.    The move, announced one day after news of a first steptoward integration of financial market supervision in theNetherlands, will involve new transaction and clearing andsettlement systems.    In addition, the bourses Amsterdam InterprofessionalMarket AIM information system will be updated in short termwith software provided by the Chicago Midwest Stock Exchange.    The Amsterdam bourse is also studying the possibleacquisition of Midwest Exchange software for a neworderrouting system, a statement said, noting the market hereremains firmly committed to the preservation of a tradingfloor.    The Bourse management feels that, despite the discussionstriggered by the intended closure of the trading floor inLondon, preparations for an overhaul of the trading floor inAmsterdam have to continue, the statement said.    The operational modernisation of the Amsterdam StockExchange follows several liberalisation measures aimed atstemming the flow of business to markets abroad.    The liberalisation, particularly the introduction ofofffloor trading in stocks and bonds on a netbasis under theAIM system, has been described by bourse officials asAmsterdams little bang, a reference to sweeping reforms lastOctober on the London Stock Exchange known as Big Bang.    AIM, started in a trial run early last year and officiallyin force from January 1 this year, is already credited withhalting the growth in Dutch stocks traded abroad, mainlyLondon.    Amsterdam, which feels an onfloor facility with fees isvital for smaller investors, said it needs to overhaul thefloor to accommodate new technology and new members.    A new floor layout and orderrouting system should be readysometime next year, the statement said.    It said it was also planning a new onscreen CentralSecurities information System with prices from internationalexchanges, including the U.S. And Japan, stock information andcompany news.    Yesterday, the bourse announced it would start coordinatingthis summer market supervision with the options and futurestrade in the Netherlands as a first step toward a unifiedfinancial markets watchdog. In addition, the bourse, optionsand gold futures price lists will be merged this April.    Transactions in Amsterdam are still processed with a nowoutdated punch card system while price information stemmingfrom the larger offfloor deals done through AIM are not yetintegrated in the bourses big board.    A bourse spokesman said the exchange hoped to launch itsscreen information service by 1989, but added this service didnot have first priority.    At present, bourse price information and companyinformation announced by the bourse are published by a printerservice while a select number of prices is available viateletext. REUTER3"

The committees consideration of one of the mostcontroversial provisions, a plan to force major trade surpluscountries to cut their trade imbalance with the United States,was deferred until the full House considers the trade bill, itssponsor Rep. Richard Gephardt said.    Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, told Reuters he was notcertain the exact form his trade surplus reduction proposalwould take. Last year the House approved his plan to force a 10pct surplus cutback each year for four years, by countries suchas Japan.    The Ways and Means Committess trade bill forces PresidentReagan to retaliate against unfair trade practices that violateinternational trade agreements but it allows him to waveretaliatory tariffs or quotas if the action would hurt the U.S.economy.    The trade bill gives U.S. Trade Representative ClaytonYeutter more authority in trade negotiations and in decisionsto grant domestic industries import relief.    It also gives him authority to decide whether foreign tradepractices are unfair and violate U.S. trading rights. Thesepowers are currently held by President Reagan.    The administration has strongly objected to this transferof authority from Reagan to Yeutter.    The bill also extends U.S. authority to negotiatemultilateral trade agreements. The bill will be wrapped intoother trade legislation and voted on in the House in April."

BristolMyers, the third largest drug company in the U.S.,said that considerable work remains to be done before it isdetermined whether a new drug application will be develpoed forsubmission to FDA.    An investigational new drug application is the first stepin testing an agent.

It may take three to five yearsbefore a new drug application is submitted and another two tothree years before the FDA approves a drug for marketing.    Earlier this month, BristolMyers said the vaccine producedantibodies to the AIDS virus in mice and monkeys. The vaccineuses a live smallpox vaccine to carry two protein on the AIDSvirus that may, in theory, prod the immune system to produceneutralizaing antibodies against AIDS.    The company is the second U.S. organization that has soughtpremission for human testing of an AIDS vaccine.

  "body": "BAT Industries Plc BTI.L 1986 results,which were at the upper end of market expectations, showed thecompany was in a strong position and that its shares wereprobably undervalued, share analysts said.    BAT shares were down at 524p in late afternoon tradingafter a previous 535p close. They touched a high of 538pearlier on news of a 19 pct rise in annual profits to 1.39billion pretax.    Stock market analysts said todays generally weak stockmarket plus unwinding of positions after heavy buying of BATshares in the runup to the results caused the fall in theshare price.    In the current market, people almost expect companies tobeat expectations, said one analyst, adding that pretax profitsof 1.35 to 1.40 billion stg had been forecast.    BATs 1986 figure of 1.39 billion stg compared with a 1985pretax profit of 1.17 billion.    Brokers noted that BATs shift away from itsunderperforming industries and the decreasing share of thetobacco portion of the group were seen as good signs.    BAT Chairman Patrick Sheehy told a news conference that thetobacco sector of the company had declined to 50 pct from 74pct four years ago.    Sheehy said he could see the tobacco portion of the companydeclining further as other sectors increased in importance.    He said BAT was looking to expand in the area of financialservices, in particular in the U.S.    Sheehy also said the group had no sizeable acquisitions insight in the near future.    Analysts said BATs increasingly good performance in theU.K. Insurance area was encouraging.    Its declining debttoequity ratio of currently about 16pct also made it likely that BAT would soon be looking to makemajor acquisitions, they said."

  "body": "Energy Secretary John Herrington hasproposed several ways to boost U.S. oil production, but he saidall would cost the Treasury money and will come under closeWhite House scrutiny before action is taken.    One measure he said he favored would raise the depletionallowance to 27.5 pct on new oil and gas production as well asproduction using enhanced extraction methods.    Herrington said such a plan would cost 200 mln dlrs a year.The White House, reacting, said it did not favor amending thetax code, but would look at the proposal.    Herringtons proposals to spur production were made alongwith the release last week of the energy departments report onenergy and the national security.    The report said U.S. oil imports, rapidly rising, could hit50 pct by the mid 1990s and have potentially damagingimplications for national security.    He has said since in speeches and at news conferences thatany plan he would back to spur lagging domestic oil productionwould have to meet three criteriaincrease production, notcause economic dislocation, and be low cost to the taxpayer.    Herrington said an import fee would meet the first test,spurring production but fail the second and third.    He said it would raise production and return 120,000 oil workers to their jobs, but at the same time it lifted oilprices, the higher prices would cost 400,000 jobs nationwideand cut the gross national product by 32 billion dlrs.    A tax on gasoline, he said, would fail the first criteriaby not increasing domestic production.    In any case, U.S. officials say, President Reagan remainsfirmly opposed to an import fee and a gasoline tax.    Options which meet Herringtons criteria include     Loanprice guarantees to shield banks from defaults byborrowers because of lower oil prices. It was estimated that ifoil fell to five dlrs a barrel it could trigger defaults thatcould cost the government an estimated 15 billion dlrs.     A five pct tax credit for exploration and development. Itwould raise oil and gas production the equivalent of 325,000barrels a day, at a cost of 740 mln dlrs a year.     A five pct credit only for geological and geophysicalexpenditures. It would increase production by 80,000 barrels aday, at a cost of 65 mln dlrs.     Lower bid minimums on outer continental shelf acreage tospur exploration. A drop from the present 150 dlrs per acre forthe typical 5,760 acre tract to 25 dlrs per acre would lowerthe cost of the standard tract lease to 144,000 dlrs.    Herrington also pressed anew for existing Administrationproposals to deregulate natural gas, which he said would cutthe need for imported oil by 300,000 barrels daily.    He also called again for Congressional approval to exploreoff the continental shelf, which may hold more than 12 billionbarrels of oil, and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, whichmay hold nine billion barrels.    Herrington said he understood the Reagans reluctance to amend the newly enacted tax code to fund some of theseproposals, but added he hoped his departments energysecuritystudy would make a strong case for the need to help thestruggling domestic oil industry.    Another move Herrington said he will press anew, eventhough it had been rejected earlier by the White House, is toraise the fillrate for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to100,000 barrels a day from its planned 1988 rate of 35,000.    This, he said, would further bolster national security incase of an oilsupply disruption."

Called the NPL, the mini supercomputers use Goulds UTX32operating system, which is a compatible multiprocessorextension of the UNIX operating system consisting of completeAT and T System V and Berkeley BSD 4.3 environments, companyofficials said at a teleconference.    The introduction of the NPL family of mini supercomputers,is by far Goulds most significant computer line developed todate, chairman James McDonald said.    Patrick Rickard, computer systems president, said that heexpects sales of NPL family computers to account for 20 pct ofthe divisions revenues for the first year after itsintroduction, and increase to 80 pct of revenues in five years.    Computer operations accounted for one third or about 300mln dlrs of Goulds total revenues for 1986 of 908.8 mln dlrs,a company spokesman said.    The NP1, the first series of the new family, uses an opensystems architecture, including parallel and high speed vectorprocessing and massive memory to achieve its supercomputingcapability, Gould officers said.    The NP1 family will form the foundation for new systemswhich are expected to be brought to market through the 1990s,McDonald said.    The computers are expected to have applications in scienceand engineering, in aerospace and defense and extend into otherareas such as medical sciences, Rick Baron, senior director ofmarketing development said.    Gould said it priced and packaged the NP1 at a cost whichwill provide the power and advantages of a traditionalsupercomputer at a fraction of the cost.    The NP1 product line includes several models priced from395,000 dlrs to 2.9 mln dlrs, Gould officials said adding thatthe company has already signed orders for eight NP1 systems.    The lowend NP1 models will be available in the 1987 thirdquarter and the highend will be available in the 1988 firstquarter, they said.    According to Gould officials, the NP1 cost 50 mln dlrs todevelop and the company plans to spend between 100 to 150 mlnto develop the rest of the family line. Between now and 1995,the company expects to ship two to three billion dlrs of NP1mini supercomputers.    Offering up to 96 mln Whetstone instructions per second and320 mln floating point operations per second, the largest ofthe new systems, Model 480, incorporates up to four billionbytes of physical memory, they said.    The NP1 family has connectability but not compatabilitywith IBM and Xerox computers, a company spokesman said."

  "title": "CANADA SETS OIL INDUSTRY AID PACKAGE",
  "body": "Canadas federal governmentwill provide a 350 mln dlr oil industry aid package thatincludes cash incentives designed to cover onethird of acompanys oil and gas exploration and development costs, EnergyMinister Marcel Masse announced.    The aid program will inject about 350 mln dlrs a year intothe oil and gas industry and could lead to more than onebillion dlrs in new investment, Masse told a news conference.    The program will affect drilling done anywhere in Canada onor after April 1, 1987.    Masse told reporters that the governments oil industry aidpackage is aimed at small and medium sized companies.    The aid package, called the Canadian Exploration andDevelopment Incentive Program, will restrict the total paymentsthat any individual company can claim to 10 mln dlrs a year.    Masse said the program will probably generate newemployment equivalent to 20,000 people working for a year.    He said oil industry aid is needed because exploration anddevelopment spending dropped by at least 50 pct since world oilprices fell during the first half of 1986.    Energy Minister Masse said the federal government decidedto provide cash incentives so a large number of nontax payingcompanies, mainly small Canadian firms, will receive the fullvalue of the incentive. Such companies would not immediatelybenefit from tax benefits, he said.    The federal government also wanted to deliver an aidprogram outside the tax system. Finance Minister Michael Wilsonis now reviewing Canadas tax system and plans to announce taxreform proposals later this spring.    An important feature of the aid program is a decision tolet companies issue flowthrough shares, allowing investors tobenefit from the subsidy rather than restricting benefits toonly participating companies, he said.    Allowing flowthrough shares under the program will make iteasier for companies to attract investors in exploration anddevelopment, Masse said.    He told reporters his department is still consideringwhether to allow partnerships and other entities to qualify forthe subsidy."

The balance will beused to increase productivity at its various facilities.    In answer to a question, Neil Springer, who on April 1becomes chairman of the companys new truck and engine holdingcompany, Navistar International Transportation Corp, said thecompanys goal is to reduce costs 25 pct by 1990.    Noting that purchased material now accounts for 81 pct ofits cost of production, Springer said Navistar intends to entersimilar relationships to one it has with Dana Corp CDN, inwhich the two companies are coordinating design, manufacture,distribution and service of components to cut costs.    Springer said because of overcapacity in some sectors,price discounting will continue to plague the truckmanufacturing industry.    He said the heavy truck industry is operating at 65 pct ofcapacity, up 10 pct from a year ago with medium truck operatingat 73 pct of capacity, about level with a year ago.    Springer said Navistar itself is operating at over 70 pctof capacity in heavy trucks and at more than 90 pct in mediumtrucks.    Asked when Navistar would begin making acquisitions,Springer said Were ready now, but we have no specifictimetable.

Under the 1978 Public Utility Regulatory Policies Actutilities are required to buy electricity from cogenerationfacilities, which produce both steam and electricity.    Since 1980, Pacific Gas has signed power purchaseagreements, required by the law, with longterm priceguarantees for more than 8,480 megawatts of capacity fromprivate producers, the company said.    About 1,870 MW of that capacity is already on line, andaccounted for about eight pct of the companys total energysales in 1986, Pacific Gas said.    The company said it will ask FERC to amend the rulesrequiring purchase of this power so that the price paid for theelectricity reflects current market values, and that utilitiesbe required to buy only electricity needed in the near term.    Contracts with cogeneration and other small power projectscould cost Pacific Gas consumers as much as 857 mln dlrsannually by 1990, the company said.

  "title": "U.S. SUGAR POLICY MAY SELFDESTRUCT, CONGRESSMAN",
  "body": "A leading U.S. farmstateCongressman, Jerry Huckaby, DLa., warned he will press nextyear for legislation to control domestic production ofsweeteners, perhaps including corn sweeteners, if the industryfails to voluntarily halt output increases this year.    Were moving toward a direction where we couldselfdestruct the U.S. sugar program, Rep. Huckaby, chairmanof the House agriculture subcommittee dealing with sugarissues, told Reuters in an interview.    Huckaby, who told U.S. sugarbeet growers earlier this yearthey must halt production increases, said he will deliver thesame message to Louisiana sugarcane growers Friday. He alsosaid he will soon talk with corn refiners on the subject.    Huckaby said the campaign to urge a halt to domesticsweetener output increases is an effort to forestall furthercuts in the sugar import quota, now at one mln short tons.    I think if were talking about dropping the quotaanother half mln tons, lets say, youre getting to the pointwhere the program might not work, he said.    Ideally, Id like to freeze things right where we are,said Huckaby, leading advocate for sugar growers in Congress.    A freeze would mean domestic sugar production at about thecurrent level of 6.5 mln tons, the corn sweetener share of theU.S. market staying at just over 50 pct, and U.S sugar importsholding at about 1.2 mln tons, Huckaby said.    A decision on whether to seek legislation will not be madeuntil 1987 output numbers are known late this year, he said.    I feel like if we didnt expand production, we couldprobably hold where we are indefinitely, or at least throughthe 1985 farm bill without any changes in the sugar program,Huckaby said.    However, much depends on whether highfructose corn syrupproducers continue to expand their share of the U.S. sweetenermarket from just over 50 pct, Huckaby said.    He noted most estimates are that corn sweeteners willcapture at most only another 10 pct of the sweetener market inthe U.S.    But he said if there were an economic breakthrough in theproduction of a new crystalline corn sweetener which furtherexpanded the corn sweetener share, then U.S. sugar importsmight be eliminated and U.S. sugar output severely reduced.    Huckaby said he will deliver this message to corn refinercompanies such as A.E. Staley and Archer Daniels Midland soon.    This program is advantageous to the corn users. They havesome natural, legitimate selfinterest in seeing that theprogram is preserved, Huckaby said.    Huckaby said he has asked sugar industry representatives tothink about how domestic output could be controlled, eitherthrough production allocations, acreage or marketing controls.    Huckaby also said he would be seeking guidance from theJustice Department to determine if it would be legal to askcorn refiners to limit production.    I dont know if we will go this route, but if we dotheres a question in my mind at this point in time can you dothat legally he said.    Asked if he would proceed with production controls withoutthe support of corn refiners, Huckaby said You build a fragilehouse if you do it that way.    Huckaby said he understands why U.S. cane and beet farmershave expanded production, because high sugar price supportmeans returns from sugar are higher than competing crops suchas soybeans and grain.    But he said for sugar growers as a whole, expansion wouldnot be good policy.    Huckaby said he has tried to stress, in his speeches tosugar industry groups, that if growers continue to expand, theymay be penalized retroactively under any production controllegislation passed next year.    Huckaby said Congress is unlikely to approve any changes inthe sugar program this year despite a Reagan administrationproposal to drastically slash the program.    The administration proposal is so drastic, that I dontthink it will get up a head of steam, Huckaby said.    He said even a more moderate proposal to reduce sugar pricesupport is unlikely to be approved.    Instead of seeking to slash the domestic sugar program,Huckaby said the Reagan administration should file a complaintwith the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade against theEuropean Communitys sugar policy. He said EC policies are themajor cause of the depressed world sugar market."

  "body": "Brazils labour unrest is spreading,with many banks, universities and government statisticaloffices on strike and more pay disputes looming.    Bankworkers leaders said that a national strike launchedyesterday to press for a 100 pct immediate pay rise and monthlysalary adjustments had the support of most of the 700,000workforce.    The strike today closed the stock exchanges of Sao Pauloand Rio de Janeiro.    For the government the one positive development on thelabour front was the gradual return to work of the nations40,000 seamen, who began a national strike on February 27.    A union spokesman in Rio de Janeiro told Reuters about halfthe seamen had returned to work after accords with 22 companiesand that the strike looked close to an end.    Otherwise the labour scene looked bleak, with the bankstrike posing the most serious problems for Brazilscrisisladen economy.    If this goes on for more than a few days it will have aserious effect because normal financial operations will grindto a halt, said a western diplomat in Sao Paulo.    Today Brazils 50,000 university teachers in the 42 federaluniversities launched a national strike, with a broad politicaldemand as well as a pay claim.    David Fleischer, head of the political science departmentin Brasilia university, told Reuters the National Associationof Higher Education Teachers wanted a full congressionalinquiry into what had happened to government education funds.    He said the universities were strapped for cash and thatthe association suspected the junior partner in the coalitiongovernment, the Liberal Front Party, PFL, of using educationfunds for projects which had helped their candidates inelections. The PFL holds the Education Ministry.    Hardly any sectors of the economy are proving immune to thecurrent labour unrest, caused by the return of high inflation,officially pegged at 33 pct for JanuaryFebruary.    Other possible strikes looming include stoppages by oilindustry workers and social security workers."

They also said the stocks are relatively inexpensive sincefear of the tax and of pending litigation regarding warninglabels for tobacco products have kept many investors awayrecently.    Philip Morris Cos MO rose 258 to 8734, RJR NabiscoRJR 114 to 5712 and U.S. Tobacco UBO 78 to 27.    The nearterm activity of these stocks has been dominatedby external factors such as smoking restriction legislation,concern over liability suits and the possible imposition ofexcise taxes, Dean Witter analyst Lawrence Adelman said. Butthe feeling is that many of those externals have beendiscounted in the price of the stocks.    Adelman, who issued a positive recommendation on PhilipMorris earlier this week, said there have been indications thatthe Reagan Administrations staunch opposition to tax hikeswould shortcircuit attempts to tax tobacco.    The tobaccos do have more risks than regular consumerstocks because of these external factors, Adelman said. Theyare not for the weakhearted, but they offer a lot of value forthe aggressive investor.    In a market where everyone is looking for affordablestocks, trader Drew Schaefer of Kidder Peabody said, it is nothard to understand why the tobaccos, which have been depressedfor a while in a positive market, are attracting buyers.    Adelman believes one of the better buys is Philip Morris.It is a powerhouse of potential growth in earnings, dividendsand free cash flow. And the stock is cheap now, he said.    Adelman expects Morris to earn eight dlrs a share this yearcompared to 6.20 dlrs a share earned a year ago. In 1988, thecompany should report a profit 10.30 dlrs a share."

But he added that the eventual use of those powers wouldnot be backdated if activated before the end of 1988.    The U.K. Government has consistently opposed the use ofunitary taxation of international business on grounds they arecontrary to internationally accepted principles, laid down bythe United Nations and the OECD, Treasury sources said.    In a written parliamentary answer, Lamont said in themeantime, progress towards a final resolution of the unitarytax issues will be kept under careful review by Britain.    Should it be necessary to take action ... Before December31, 1988, it will not apply to dividends paid before the dateof the announcement of such action. If it is necessary to takeaction thereafter, it will not apply to dividends on or beforeDecember 31, 1988, Lamont said.    The Reagan Administratian published draft legislation latein 1985 to limit states use of unitary taxation to the profitsmade inside the U.S., Known as the waters edge method.    In response to that draft legislation, Britain agreed todefer initiating action under its Finance Act 1985  but onlyon the understanding that legislation to resolve the unitarytax issue would be made law and take effect from endDecember1986.    Then the U.S. Administration said in September 1986 that ithad decided not to pursue Federal legislation, in view of thepassing of legislation in California.    Britain, however, considers the California legislationunsatisfactory, not least because U.K. Business will have topay a fee for the right of not being assessed by the unitarytax method, government sources said."

CBS president Laurence Tisch and hisbrother Preston, who is President Reagans postmaster general.    The indictment was handed down by a federal grand jury toin New York.    The three indicted were named as Charles Atkins, WilliamHack and Ernest Grunebaum, all wellknown promoters of taxshelters. Atkins was wellknown as an organizer of tax sheltersin the late 1970s and early 1980.    The indictment said that between 1978 and 1983, thedefendants conspired to defraud the government by arrangingrigged and fraudulent transactions in governmenmt securitiesand false tax deductions based on phony trading losses andinterest expenses.    More than 350 mln dlrs in false deductions were passed onto partners in three tax shelters.    In addition, the defendants sold over 200 mln dlrs in phonytrading losses and interest expenses to other entities andindividuals to be used as tax deductions.    The indictment said that over 1.1 billion dlrs in tradinglosses and interest expenses were generated by the scheme butwere offset by fictious gains.    Laurence Tisch was said by the indictment to have reporteda net loss of 1.1 mln dlrs. His brother, Preston Tisch,reported a loss of 480,000 dlrs.    None of the three mens clients were charged with anycriminal acts. But should the three be found guilty, theirclients will be required to pay taxes they originally avoidedthrough the tax shelter scheme, plus interest and possiblypenalties."

  "body": "Argentine grain producers againreduced their estimates for the total yield of the 198687soybean crop, which will begin to be harvested in midApril,trade sources said.    They said growers now forecast soybean production thisseason at between 7.5 and 7.8 mln tonnes, down from last weeksestimate of 7.7 to eight mln tonnes and the 8.0 to 8.4 mlntonnes forecast in midFebruary.    The new forecast is still higher than last seasons recordtotal production.    Private sources put 198586 production at a record 7.2 to7.3 mln tonnes  4.2 to 6.4 pct lower than the new forecastfor the current crop. The official figure for 198586 is 7.1mln tonnes, 5.6 to 9.9 pct below this seasons new estimates.    Growers in the past week discovered more empty soybean podsin the main producing areas of southern Cordoba and Santa Feprovinces and northern Buenos Aires.    The crop since January has been hit by high temperaturesand inadequate rainfall. Growers fear they may find more emptypods and have to further reduce their forecasts of total yield.    The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 to3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct higher than the 198586record of 3.34 mln hectares.    The state of the crop continued to be good in general untillast week but intense, heavy rains since could have causeddamage in areas where rainfall was higher than 100 mm.    Where the rains were less heavy they were consideredbeneficial although too late to improve yield estimates.    The rains also benefitted maize and sorghum crops insouthern Buenos Aires province but are not expected toinfluence production forecasts.    In other areas, especially western Buenos Aires, whererainfall was more than 200 mm, parts of the sunflower, maizeand sorghum crops not yet harvested may have been damaged.    The coarse grain crop harvest was interrupted last week byrains which also reached over 100 mm in parts of Cordoba, LaPampa and Santa Fe and almost 90 mm in parts of Entre Rios.    The area sown with maize this season was between 3.58 and3.78 mln hectares, two to seven pct less than the 3.85 mlnhectares in 198586.    The yield of 198687 maize continued to be forecast atbetween 9.9 and 10.1 mln tonnes.    This estimate is 19.8 to 20.2 pct lower than the 12.4 to12.6 mln tonnes at which private sources put 198586 productionand 21.1 to 22.7 pct lower than the official 12.8 mln tonnes.    The sunflowerseed harvest has covered 23 to 26 pct of thearea sown and continues in parts of central Buenos Airesalthough at a standstill elsewhere due to rain and floods.    A resumption of full harvesting and assessment of damage isimpossible until rains stop and a spell of a week to 10 days ofsunshine dries the fields.    The area sown this season was 2.0 to 2.2 mln hectares, down29.9 to 36.3 pct on last years record 3.14 mln hectares.    Sunflowerseed 198687 production is still forecast at 2.3to 2.6 mln tonnes, 34.1 to 41.5 pct below the 198586 record of4.1 mln tonnes.    The grain sorghum harvest was the least affected by therains, advancing steadily in Santa Fe and Cordoba and startingin La Pampa to cover 14 to 16 pct of the total area sown.    The area sown was 1.23 to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3 to 15.2pct less than the 1.45 mln hectares the previous season.    Yield estimates remained at 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes, 16.7 to22 pct down on 198586 production of 4.1 to 4.2 mln tonnes."

The resolution supports negotiation of a bilateral tradingagreement with the United States while protecting Canadianpolitical sovereignty, social programs, agricultural marketingsystems, the auto industry and Canadas cultural identity.    Senate Finance Committee chairman Lloyd Bentsen said theresolution may jeopardize the viability of the proposed freetrade agreement between the two countries, which are eachothers largest trading partners.    We need a truly free trade agreement, which means bothcountries have to work toward a deal that is mutuallybeneficial and comprehensive, a large agreement, the TexasDemocrat said in a statement.    I do not question Canadas right to protect its politicalsovereignty or cultural identity. However, if these phrasesmean the government of Canada means to take important economicissues off the table in these negotiations, I am deeplyconcerned, he added.    Bentsen said Canada restricts trade 15 different ways whilethe United States uses only six trade restriction methods. Hesaid if Canada proposes an agreement where both countries getrid of six methods of trade restriction, it would not be fairand might not win Senate approval.    I am deeply concerned that when the President visits PrimeMinister Brian Mulroney next month, he will be presented withthis kind of argument, and I hope he makes it clear  as I didwhen I was in Canada  that only a mutually beneficialagreement will be successful, Bentsen said.    Reagan and Mulroney are scheduled to meet April 56 inOttawa.    Bentsen urged Mulroney to withdraw a proposal that wouldban imports of independently produced films into Canada bynonCanadians, which the senator called a protectionistmeasure."

But Assistant Transportation Secretary Matthew Scocozzasaid at a Senate antitrust committee hearing he would notobject to a transfer of the departments authority over airlinemergers to the Justice Department.    Scocozza and Deputy Assistant Attorney General RogerAndewelt said both departments felt airlines should be judgedunder the same antitrust standards as all other industries.    The Transportation Department is due to lose its authorityin 1989, but subcommittee chairman Howard Metzenbaum wants itshifted now because he feels the Department has approved toomany airline mergers.    Airline mergers have proceeded at a breakneck pace withbarely a whimper being uttered by the Department ofTransportation. Nine airlines control 94 per cent of themarket, the Ohio Democrat said.    Metzenbaum said he was concerned about the effects thepending U.S.AirPiedmont Airlines merger would have onservice, especially at Dayton, Ohio, a major Piedmont hub.    Scocozza said even with the recent mergers, such as TexasAir Corps acquisition of Eastern Air Lines and People Express,more airlines were flying now in the United States than beforethe 1978 airline deregulation act.    Airline deregulation has worked, is working, and, giventhe departments commitment to preserving a competitiveenvironment, will continue to work, Scocozza said.    He said the department considers the effect each mergerwill have on competition over all the routes involved and willnot approve a merger which will reduce competition.    Scocozza said most of the recent mergers involved airlinesin financial difficulty being taken over by other carriers.     Andewelt said he was optimistic competition would increaseas airlines expanded airport hubs and routes and believed theindustry did not need special treatment under antitrust laws.    It is time to treat the airline industry in precisely thesame way as other U.S. industries any differences are notsignificant for the purpose of merger analysis, Andewelt said."

  "body": "Columbia Gas System Inc said aFederal Energy Regulatory Commission decision today on naturalgas cost recovery could reduce its 1987 earnings by about 1.25dlrs a share.    The company said this could bring earnings for 1987 belowColumbias stated goal of earning no less than its 3.18 dlrsper share dividend. It earned 2.12 dlrs a share in 1986.    It said management expects to recommend to the board thatthe dividend rate be maintained in 1987.    Columbia Gas said the impact of the FERC decision may beoffset by a onetime accounting change rleated to future taxliabilities under the new federal tax laws.    The company recorded these liabilities based on older,higher tax rates, but an action being considered by theFinancial Accounting Standards Board could result in a gain ofabout 1.20 dlrs a share in 1987, it explained.    Thus there is a good chance that we will attain our 1987earnings goal  although not in the way originally planned,Columbia Gas said.    Columbia Gas said the FERC decision would limit therecovery of certain gas contract costs by Columbia GasTransmission Corp, the companys principal pipeline subsidiary.    It said the decision specifically excluded from a purchasedgas adjustment filing by the pipeline costs related toamortizing payments made to producers to reform gas purchasecontracts. These were excluded on the grounds the subsidiaryfailed to sufficiently support cost recovery.    The company said its subsidiary is not precluded frommaking a new filing to provide sufficient support."

The officials, asking not to be identified, said thegovernment will investigate an industry contention that steel imported from countries such as South Korea and Taiwan is beingdiverted to the U.S. and ultimately exasperating concerns aboutthe level of Canadian exports south of the border.    But the senior officials, asking not to be indentified,said that despite intense pressure from the ReaganAdministration, Ottawa was not considering any kind of formallimits on Canadian shipments to the U.S.    In a sense what I hope we are doing is buying some time,said one official who claimed Canadian companies were fairtraders in the big American market.    If approved by the Canadian cabinet, the officials said a monitoring system will be established in the next three or fourmonths.    I guess if we find transshipment is a problem, we wouldhave to do something about it, said a trade official.    Canadian steel shipments to the U.S. have risen to 5.7 pctof the U.S. market in recent months, almost double the leveljust two years ago.    The increase in Canadian shipments comes at a time ofgrowing anger in the U.S. over rising steel imports fromseveral countries in the face of a decline among domestic steelproducers.    Some U.S. lawmakers have proposed Canadas share of theAmerican market be limited to 2.4 per cent.    The Ontario Government has urged Ottawa to require foreigncompanies to obtain permits to import steel into the country.Currently, import licences are required only for carbon or rawsteel, which makes up less than half the steel market.    Canada exported two billion Canadian dlrs worth of steel in1986, while importing 944mln dlrs worth of the product in thesame year."

Certain consumers are concerned that differentials includedin the draft buffer stock package are out of line with marketrealities, consumer delegates said.    Unless these are modified there are fears it would promotepurchases of quality cocoas, such as Ghana origin, which arenormally required by manufacturers, they said.

Digesting its acquisitions of hotels, Pan Am Corps Pacificair routes, and Hertz rental cars, combined with stiff air farecompetition has left the company with an undervalued stockprice, analysts said.    The vulnerability of UALs stock has fueled takeoverspeculation, as have reports that real estate magnate DonaldTrump has bought a large amount of its stock.    Today, a UAL executive told Reuters its chairman RichardFerris spoke with Trump last week. Trump said his interest inthe stock was as an investment, but the executive said thecompany does not know how much Trump owns or whether he has anyother plans.    UAL senior vice president Kurt Stocker said the companybelieves its diversification strategy will work since it canfeed customers from one business to another. Several weeks ago,it announced the new name of Allegis, to be taken in May.    The strategy that Dick Ferris was talking about a coupleweeks ago when we announced the Allegis name is that the wholereally ends up to be worth more than the sum of the parts.Unfortunately, some people havent really come to thisunderstanding, Stocker said.    But those same parts  Westin Hotels, Hertz rental cars,United Airlines and its reservation system  also has WallStreet calculating a wide range of breakup values from about100 dlrs per share to 130 dlrs per share.    Analysts arent so sure the strategy is going to work. Theymention Transworld Corp, initially Trans World Airlines,as an example of an airline diversification gone wrong.Transworld Corp ended up spinning off its TWA airline.Transworld, now TW Services, is selling Hilton International toUAL.    If you want to be negatively biased you say its a stupidphilosophy, and if youre United and you put billions of dlrsinto other acquisitions, this is a good idea. Theres not muchevidence one way or the other, said Dean Witter analyst MarkDaugherty.    In the short or long run, they all UALs businesses makemoney and perform well, said Stocker. He said the stock pricehasnt caught on since the strategy is relatively new.    Analysts say its because earnings are relatively poor.Earnings last year were 25 cts per share. Louis Marckesano ofJanney Montgomery predicts 1987 net of 3.50 dlrs per share.    Theyre potential is enormous. I think their problem hasbeen execution. The strike was the single biggest factor thatset them back in 1985. Last year, the whole industry wasinvolved in fare wars. They were hit harder by the fare warsthan anyone else, said Marckesano.    Marckesano said United Airlines was particularly hurt bythe fare wars because it shares a Denver hub with Texas AirCorps priceslashing Continental Airlines.    Analysts said the same strategy which has contributed to anundervalued stock price may also result in a strong takeoverdefense. They said UAL paid a lot for some of its assets andthat in itself may make the company undesireable.    I think they have a fairly tough management that will atleast be able to do battle with a potential shark and may wellbe able to defeat them. These guys arent pushovers, saidSteve Lewins, an airline analyst at Citicorp.    Lewins believes the company could ultimately boost thestock price to a level that would reflect its assets, but itwill take time and improvements in earnings.    If they put their nose to the grindstone, were talkingabout years for anyone in the airline industry, he said.The whole unwinding of the battle of Texas Air is going totake years, establishing the Pacific in competition with NWAInc NWA Northwest is going to take until 1990, Lewins said.     UAL today rose 212 to 6212 on heavy volume of 1.9 mlnshares."

  "body": "The Securities Industry Associationbacked a variety of restraints on insider trading and hostilecorporate takeovers and asked Congress to define insidertrading in law.    The industry trade association called on U.S. securitiesfirms to take steps to protect sensitive corporate secrets toguard against illegal trading by employees.    The association also backed broad federal restrictions on avariety of tactics used in hostile corporate takeovers.    But it said investment banking firms should be allowed tocontinue to engage in both arbitrage and merger and acquisitionactivities so long as those functions were kept separate.    The SIA, in a report adopted yesterday by its board ofdirectors, backed a higher enforcement budget for the federalSecurities and Exchange Commission and called on U.S. stockexchanges to beef up their supervision of member brokerages.    The report said securities firms should be more rigorous inrestricting sensitive information on a needtoknow basis.    It said firms should train their employees to understandthe need for confidentiality of marketsensitive information.    It said legislation to define insider trading should avoidexpanding current law in a way that would impede the market.    It said an insider trading definition should exempt asecurities firm from liability for law violations by itsemployees unless the firm had participated in or was aware ofthe wrongdoing.    In the mergers and acquisitions area, the associationadvocated a ban on greenmail payments or poison pill takeoverprotection plans without prior shareholder approval.    It said a group or individual buying up a companys stockshould be required to file a public disclosure statement beforeacquiring more than five pct of the companys shares. Undercurrent law, disclosure may be made as late as ten days afterexceeding the five pct limit.    The association said all purchases exceeding 20 pct of acompanys voting stock shouls be made only through a tenderoffer open to all shareholders. Under current law there is nolimit on open market purchases.    The group said the federal government should preempt stateregulation of defensive takeover tactics.    The group said all tender offers should remain open for atleast 30 calendar days.    The current requirement is expressed in business days.    It said socalled lockup devices, in which securities areissued to a friendly investor to seal a takeover deal or fendoff an unfriendly predator should be limited to 18.5 pct of thetarget companys total common stock.    Association president Edward OBrien said the group actedout of concern over the ad hoc restructuring of corporateAmerica on Wall Street and investor fears about insider tradingand fairness in the marketplace."

The auditors point out, as Texaco has in the past, thecompanys loss of any of several pending court decisions inthis case could cause it to face prospects such as having toseek protection of its assets and business pursuant to thebankruptcy and reorganization provisions of Chapter 11 of thefederal bankruptcy code.    Commenting on a Texas Court of Appeals ruling which reducedPennzoils judgement by two billion dlrs, to 9.1 billion dlrs,Texaco said it will file a motion for a rehearing by theappeals court no later than March 30.    Texaco said the proven crude oil reserves of the companyand its consolidated subsidiaries totaled 2.54 billion barrelsat the end of 1986, down from 2.69 billion a year earlier.    However, inclusion of Texacos equity in the EasternHemisphere reserves of a nonsubsidiary company limited thedecline to 2.91 billion barrels from 3.00 billion at the end of1985.    Worldwide production by the consolidated subsidiariesdeclined to 341 mln barrels last year from 362 mln in 1985 andupward revisions in previous reserve estimates rose to 143 mlnbarrels from 117 mln, respectively.    Texaco said the largest drop in reserves came in the UnitedStates  where the total dropped to 1.46 billion barrels from1.55 billion.    The company said U.S. liquids production averaged 660,000barrels per day last year, down from 714,000 in 1985, withabout 44 pct of the decline  some 24,000 barrels per day representing highcost production shutin or curtailed inresponse to the decline in crude oil prices during 1986.

In a letter to shareholders in its 1986 annual report, theregional Bell company did not indicate the degree of earningsdilution it expects from the acquisitions, which total some1.38 billion dlrs. However, the company said the rise in itsdebt ratio will be temporary and will leave its debt levelwithin an acceptable range.    In its 1986 yearend financial statement, Southwestern Belllisted a debttoequity ratio of 43.4 pct, down slightly from43.7 pct in 1985.    In 1986, the company earned 1.02 billion dlrs, or 10.26dlrs a share, compared with 996.2 mln dlrs, or 10 dlrs a sharein 1985. Revenues dipped to 7.90 billion dlrs from 7.93 billiondlrs.    Southwestern Bell said it expects the new tax law to have anegative impact on its cash flow, due mainly to the loss ofinvestment tax credits.    By midyear, however, the company said a reduced corporatetax rate should have a positive impact on its net income andcash flow.    In addition, the company said it is projecting a 1.7 pctgain in customer telephone lines and a three to four pctincrease in long distance calling volumes.

  "body": "Bolivias proposal to repurchase at adeep discount the 900 mln dlrs it owes to foreign commercialbanks is likely to be accepted, bolivian central bank governorJavier Nogales Iturri said.    Speaking to reporters at the annual meeting of the InterAmerican Development Bank, Nogales said Bolivias bank advisorycommittee, led by Bank of America, is seeking permission fromcreditor banks worldwide to go ahead with the scheme.    More than 50 pct of the banks must approve, and Nogalessaid he is confident this threshold will be reached.    Its working out very well, and I think well get a clearmajority, Nogales said.    A senior banker working on the deal also said that banksare responding positively and said all the legal waiversnecessary could be obtained within two months.    Bolivia halted all payments on its commercial bank debt inMarch 1984. Hyperinfltion has been curbed and public spendingtrimmed, but the countrys debt still trades as low as 10 ctson the dollar on the secondary market, and many banks havewritten off most, if not all, of their loans to the country.    Few bankers see little chance for a subtantive recovery inBolivias economic fortunes and so are willing to collect whatthey can on the loans.    Nogales said Bolivia would offer to buy back the debt at amarket price. He said some banks might want to hold out for ahigher price, but others would see the repurchase offer as anopportunity to cut their losses.    Bolivia intends to pay for the repurchase with aid thatforeign goernments, especially the United States and WestGermany, are providing to help finance the eradication of cocacrops. Cocaine, although illegal, is Bolivias largest export.    The campaign to persuade farmers to grow legal cropsinstead of coca would be financed instead using local currency,Nogales said.    Because the fiscal deficit has been reduced to some fourpct of gross domestic product, money supply could be increasedto pay for the drugeradication drive without too much of nimpact on inflation, he added.    Nogales said he does not expect Bolivias debt repurchaseto become a model for other debtors in dire straits. Were notseeking a universal solution, he said."

Miller criticised a proposal by House speaker Jim Wright toput a one pct tax on securities transactions.    He said the tax would probably be ineffective becausepeople would avoid by holding their portfolios in otherinstruments, like real estate, or simply by not trading asoften.    Miller said he doubted this proposal would pass.    I think it is frankly all but political suicide toadvocate a tax increase unless the president championed it aswell, he said.

  "body": "U.S. soybean lobbyists andcongressional aides criticized a proposal from a seniorAgriculture Department official that Congress allow the U.S.soybean loan level to be officially lowered to 4.56 dlrs perbushel next year.    I dont know who in Congress would propose that happening.Politically it would be totally unacceptable, an aide to asenior farmstate senator said.    USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz said this week thatCongress should give USDA authority to keep the soybean loan at its current effective rate of 4.56 dlrs per bushel ratherthan increasing it to its minimum allowed level of 4.77 dlrs.    Im convinced that Congress will not go along with this,American Soybean Association President Dave Haggard said.    Amstutz told reporters following a senate hearing that ifthe soybean loan rate were 4.56 dlrs, USDA could then considerways to make U.S. soybeans more competitive.    His comments were seen as possibly indicating what the  theadministrations position is in the debate over what should bedone to make soybeans competitive and at the same time protectsoybean farmers income.    Using soybean specific certificates to further buydown theloan rate or implementation of a marketing loan have beenpointed to as the most effective ways to get soybean pricescompetitive. USDA secretary Richard Lyng, however, continues tomaintain his opposition to a marketing loan, saying such a movewould be too costly.    There will be alot of other options that will beconsidered before Congress looks at that one the Amstutzproposal, said Bill OConner, aide to Rep. Edward MadiganRIll, ranking minority leader of the Agriculture Committee.    Anybody representing large groups of soybean producerswould not be very excited about supporting a lower soybeanloan, OConner said.    Congress may very likely look at the soybean loan anddecide that they cannot increase it from its current 5.02 dlrbasic rate, but that there has to be something mandated toincrease soybeans competitiveness, David Graves, aide to Sen.Thad Cochran RMiss said. Cochran, a staunch supporter of asoybean marketing loan, would support a soybean loan of 5.02 or4.77 dlrs with a certificate buydown, Graves said."

Speaking to reporters at the annual meeting of theInterAmerican Development Bank IADB here, Nogales saidBolivias bank advisory committee, led by Bank of America, isseeking permission from creditor banks worldwide to go aheadwith the scheme. More than 50 pct of the banks must give theirapproval, and Nogales said he is confident that this thresholdwill be reached.    Its working out very well, and I think well get clearmajority, Nogales said.    A senior banker working on the deal also said that banksare responding positively and said all the legal waiversnecessary could be obtained within two months.    Bolivia halted all payments on its commercial bank debt inMarch 1984. Hyperinflation has been curbed and public spendingtrimmed, but its debt is still trading as low as 10 cts on thedollar on the secondary market and many banks have written offmost, if not all, of their loans to the country.    Bankers see little chance for a substantive recovery inBolivias economic fortunes and so are willing to collect whatthey can on the loans.    Nogales said Bolivia would offer to buy back the debt at amarket price. He said some banks might want to hold out for ahigher price, but others would see the repurchase offer as awindow of opportunity to cut their losses.    Bolivia intends to pay for the repurchase with aid thatforeign governments, especially the United States and WestGermany, are providing to help finance the eradication of cocacrops. Cocaine, although illegal, is Bolivias largest export.    The campaign to persuade farmers to grow legal cropsinstead of coca would be financed instead using local currency,Nogales said.    Because the fiscal deficit has been reduced to some fourpct of gross domestic product, money supply could be increasedto pay for the drugeradication drive without too much of nimpact on inflation, he added.    Nogales said he did not expect Bolivias debt repurchase tobecome a model for other debtors in dire straits. Were notseeking a universal solution, he said."

In a filing with the ICC late today, the company outlinedfour conditions of its offer to acquire Southern Pacific.    Among the conditions are that Santa Fe enter into anagreement to indemnify Kansas City for any contigent liabilitesof Southern Pacific existing as of the closing date, and thatthe financial condition of Southern remain largely unchangedfrom today onward.    We are willing, even eager, to make a fair market valueoffer in cash for the Southern Pacific, said Kansas CitySouthern president and chief executive officer Landon H.Rowland.    This offer disproves the constant derogation of theSourthern Pacific by SFSP management, best exemplified by SFSPChief Executive John Schmidts comment in ICC hearings that theSouthern Pacific was bankrupt, said Rowland.    He said that merging Southern with Kansas City will achievethe benefits of an endtoend merger while preseving theindependece of the Southern Pacific versus its existing primecompetitor, Santa Fe.    Kansas said that Southerns management had estimated thevalue of the railroad in 1983 in the range of 281 mln dlrs to1.2 billion dlrs.    It said that Morgan Stanley and Co Inc and Salomon BrothersInc, hired in 1983 to advise Southern and Santa Fe in theirmerger, appraised Southern as worth between 500 mln dlrs and800 mln dlrs less than Southerns own internal valuations.    Kanasa City Southern said it will make an offer forSouthern after its books, records and properties are examined.    Once that examination has been completed and even in theabsence of a willingnes of SFSP to negotiate KCSI will make anoffer in writing.... said the company.    Kansas also said it argued in the ICC filing that Santa Fehad not met the legal requirements justifying the Commissionsreconsideration of the proposed merger of Santa Fe and SouthernPacific, two railroads that it said basically parallel eachother throughout their routes.    ICC voted four to one last summer to reject the merger asinherently anticompetitive. Kansas said Santa Fe in petitioningfor reconsideration now argues that the trackage agreementswith the Union Pacific, the Denver and Rio Grande Western andother railroads, adds to the value of the merger."

RKO General would receive 217 mln dlrsand Fidelilty Television, which challenged the license, wouldget about 103 mln dlrs.    The partners also said the Federal CommunicationsCommission established an expedited schedule for receivingcomments on their request for special temporary authorizationof proposed trust arrangements while the FCC considers a formalapplication for transfer of the broadcast unit.    Reed said he was pleased with the expedited schedulebecause it provides time for the agency to act on the requestbefore the expiration of the tender offer.    He said it was the aim of the partners to move as quicklyas possible to eliminate uncertainty surrounding the stations.    Asked about criticism of the takeover attempt voiced bysome municipal officials in Akron, Ohio, where GenCorp isheadquartered, Reed said, the plan of the partners offers longterm growth for Ohio.    He noted that the aerospace business, slated fordivestiture under the partners plan, is located in California.Our program is one that overall would provide the greatestlong term growth for all segments, he said."

  "body": "Unocal Corp said it intends toincrease its spending for capital projects to 929 mln dlrs in1987, eight pct more than the 862 mln spent in 1986.    The company said in its annual report that it wouldincrease spending for exploration and development of petroleumresources by about three pct to 614 mln dlrs from 1986s 595mln dlrs, assuming oil prices hold around current levels.    The planned spending for exploration and production in 1987remains well below the 1.1 billion dlrs spent in 1985, Unocalsaid.    The companys proved developed and undeveloped reserves ofcrude oil rose slightly in 1986, Unocal said. Net crude oil andcondensate reserves were 752 mln bbls as of Dec 31, 1986,compared to 751 mln bbls at the end of 1985, Unocal said.    The company said its net crude oil and condensateproduction averaged 248,200 barrels per day in 1986 compared to251,300 bpd in 1985.    Unocal said its worldwide natural gas reserves were 6.07billion cubic feet in 1986 compared to 1985s 6.19 billion. Netnatural gas output averaged 976 mln cubic feet per day in 1986,down 10 pct from 1985s 1,084 mln, the company said.    Unocal said its average sales prices for crude oil was12.67 dlrs a barrel worldwide in 1986 compared to 23.81 dlrs in1985, and its average sales price for natural gas was 2.03 dlrsper thousand cubic feet in 1986 against 2.24 dlrs in 1985.    Average production costs for crude oil and natural gasdeclined nearly 30 pct to 3.41 dlrs per bbl of oil equivalentin 1986 from 4.81 dlrs in 1985, Unocal said.    In the annual report, the company called for imposition ofan oil import fee by the U.S. government to set a floor priceof about 25 dlrs a barrel for crude oil.    Simply stabilizing prices at about 18 dlrs per barrel    will not materialy slow the drop in U.S. production or the risein imports, Chairman Fred Hartley said in the annual report.    Without decisive action in Washington, this nation willonce again become a hostage to OPECs plans and policies,Hartley said."

  "body": "Blizzard conditions in parts of thewest and southwest U.S. severely stressed beef cattle andKansas cattlemen are reporting death losses from the storm,according to livestock associations in the area.    Talk among futures traders that cattle had died from thecold and blowing snow accounted for some of the strength inLive Cattle futures at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange today.    Death of cattle can be directly attributed to the storm,but its hard to get a handle on a number, Todd Domer,director of communications for the Kansas Livestock Associationsaid.    Domer noted that limited reports have been filtering in ofdeath losses at feedyards and from grazing and cowcalfoperations. Western Kansas was hardest hit while Eastern Kansasonly had rain, he said.    Paul Johnston of the Nebraska Livestock Feeders Associationsaid, Theres no question that baby calves coming in that kindof blizzard are probably not going to make it.    We were having such a nice winter and the cows were outcalving before the storm hit, he added.    The worst part of the storm came through the center of thestate. Precipitation was generally in the form of wet snow andsome feedlots are already like soup, he said, inhibitingcattle movements.    The storm also had an effect on weight gain of largeranimals. Drifting snow caused problems in moving feed and mudmade it hard for cattle to reach the feed once it wasavailable.    Domer noted that feedyards sources say a tremendous cutbackhas occurred in feed consumption by cattle in the yards, whichmay or may not lead to sickness over the next several days.Cattle reduced daily feed consumption to about 12 lbs from 25during the worst of the blizzard, he said.    Mud will be more a problem as the weather breaks and snowmelts. Mud adds to stress on fullgrown animals and endangerssmaller ones which can fall and be trampled in pens. The costof feeding rises as animals generally consume more in coldweather, Domer said.    Domer said it will be at least 10 days before yards getback to normal.    Roy Gallant, from Accu Weather Services, said that althoughthe worst of the storm is over, there are still some stronggusty winds which will not diminish until tonight.    The storm started late Sunday night in West Kansas and isjust now winding down. The storm has moved into South Dakota,parts of Minnesota and Eastern North Dakota, he said.    Snow accumulations from the storm totaled six to 10 inchesin most sections and 12 to 18 in a few spots before movingnorth. This equals 12 to 112 inches of water. Drifts of fourto six feet and up to 12 feet were reported, he said.    Theres a possibility of another storm brushing that regiontomorrow night and Friday, Gallant added."

Production should begin late in the year from the HarvestPlatform in the Santa Maria Basin offshore California, thecompany said. Pennzoils share of this production initiallyshould be five thousand barrels a day, increasing to a peak of15 thousand barrels a day, net, by 1989.    In its sulphur business, Pennzoil said production totaled2.1 mln long tons last year, a decline of 18 pct from 1985. Theaverage sales price also declined, to 138.25 dlrs per long tonfrom 141.05 dlrs in 1985.    The long term outlook for our sulphur operations remainsbright, the company said.

  "body": "A senior representative of thefinanciallytroubled U.S. farm credit system is expected forthe first time tomorrow to ask Congress to provide assurancesthat stock held by system borrowers will be guaranteed.    Farm credit sources said Brent Beesley, president of theFarm Credit Corporation which represents the system, will makethe request at a Senate Agriculture subcommittee hearing.    They said Beesley would ask Congress to take some action toassure borrowers the stock is secure. But Beesley is expectedto stop short of requesting other forms of government aid.    Borrowers from the farm credit system hold some fourbillion dlrs in system stock which could be devalued if themounting losses of the system persist, officials said.    Beesleys request expected tomorrow is seen as the firstofficial acknowledgment from the system itself that federal aidwill be needed to guarantee the value of the stock.    Yesterday, Jim Billington, a member of the Farm CreditAdministration board which regulates the system, said Congressshould plan to spend at least 800 mln dlrs beginning late thisyear to bailout the system.    Congress is moving swiftly toward legislation to aid thesystem. Sen. James McClure, RIdaho, has drafted a resolutionwhich would put the Senate on record as guaranteeing the valueof farm credit system stock. The resolution may be brought tothe Senate floor soon, Congressional sources said.    In addition to requesting a guarantee of borrower stock,Beesley is expected tomorrow to endorse the creation of asecondary market, called Aggiemae by some proponents, forthe resale of farm real estate loans.    Sources said the farm credit system will support the ideaif the system is included in the operation of the market.    Farm credit sources said the system decided to request aguarantee of borrower stock at a meeting this week in Denver ofthe 12 presidents of farm credit system districts.    Beesleys testimony to the Congressional hearing tomorrowwill not include any new financial forecast of system losses,officials said.    Chairman of the FCA, Frank Naylor, yesterday said thesystem may lose as much as 1.4 billion dlrs this year."

Lomac will pay 17 mln dlrs to help clean the site, theysaid.    Stewart Freeman, Michigans chief environmental attorney,told Reuters that Lomac, a new company, agreed to buy achemical site near Muskegon, Mich., formerly operated by BaforsNobel Inc, a bankrupt subsidiary of A.B. Nobel of Sweden.    The settlement was also the largest in history in abankruptcy case involving environmental issues, Freeman said.    Other companies with Superfund disputes are watching thecase closely, he said. There are a number of very largecorporations talking to the attorney general, Freeman said,referring to Michigan Atty. Gen. Frank J. Kelley.    Freeman would not identify the companies involved, sayinghe was not sure whether confidentiality agreements had beenmade.    Lomac will pay 2526 mln dlrs in the settlement. Five mlndlrs will be paid to the federal and 12 mln dlrs will go to theMichigan government for cleanup at the site, the LakewayChemical plant.    The remaining funds will go to medical surveillance offormer workers at the plant.    Under the agreement, a trust fund will be set up tomonitor the health of employees who may have been exposed todangerous chemicals that were manufactured at the plant before1971, the Michigan attorney generals office said in astatement.    Freeman said the medical fund was necessary because ofpossible medical problems among workers at the site.    The Muskegon facility was formerly used to manufacturedyes. Freeman said Bofors Nobel spent 50 mln dlrs cleaning upthe site, formerly owned by Lakeway Chemical Co, before theeconomic decision was made in Sweden to place the operation inbankruptcy.    Under the agreement, Bofors Nobel will sell the site, whichstill holds an operating chemical plant, to Lomac. Some 150employees work at the plant, a spokesman for the Michiganattorney general said.    The state attorney general said cleanup at the site willbegin immediately, and will be supervised by federal andstate officials.    Freeman said the plant site is not presently listed on thefederal superfund list, which qualifies the toxic waste sitefor federal cleanup funds.    He said federal officials will try to get the Muskegonfacility onto the superfund list. If they are unable to do so,the 5.0 mln dlr federal portion of the settlement will beturned over to Michigan officials to be used in the cleanup,Freeman said."

  "body": "The House Energy and CommerceCommittee approved major trade legislation that will givePresident Reagan authority to retaliate if negotiations to openforeign markets to U.S. telecommunications products fail.    The provision was part of a major trade bill the committeeapproved on a vote of 26 to 15. It will be wrapped into a tradebill being written in several House committees and due to beconsidered in the full House in late April.    The bill also requires foreign investors to file detailedreports to the Commerce Department on their U.S. holdings inreal estate, securities or U.S. companies.    In response to congressional concern over the Fujitsuproposal to take control of Fairchild Semiconductor Corp., thebill would give Reagan the power to bar foreign acquisitions ofU.S. firms if the sale threatened U.S. national security.    The legislation would bar for one year imports of advancedaudio digital tape machines unless the recording capability isdisabled. The action was taken after the U.S. recordingindustry said the new machines would lead to rampant recordingpiracy and legislation was needed to protect their rights.    The bill authorizes government spending of 100 mln dlrs ayear for five years to help pay for research by a consortia ofsemiconductor manufacturers."

  "title": "COST OF PIK CERTIFICATES TO BE EYED BY CONGRESS",
  "body": "Congress, eager to find budgetsavings, launches a review of the U.S. Agriculture Departmentsgeneric commodity certificate program tomorrow, amid signs USDAand the General Accounting Office, GAO, are at odds over howmuch the program has cost U.S. taxpayers.    The GAO concluded in a preliminary report last week thatpaymentinkind, or PIK, certificates cost between five and 20pct more than cash outlays, administration officials who askednot to be identified said.    USDA officials, however, took issue with the report, sayingit did not take into account storage, handling and transportsavings that accrue to the government. The GAO then decided toreexamine the costs, sources said.    The issue is an important one, because congressional budgetcommittees are known to be considering limiting the use ofcertificates as a means of cutting spending.    Agriculture Under Secretary Daniel Amstutz and GAO SeniorAssociate Director Brian Crowley are set to testify before theSenate Agriculture Committee tomorrow.    Amstutz is expected to tell the committee that there areuncertainties in determining the cost of certificates comparedto cash outlays, and that savings to the Commodity Credit Corp,CCC, almost equal costs, department sources said.    USDA estimates that it costs the government about 75 centsto store, handle and transport each bushel of commodity put ingovernment storage.    It was unclear whether the GAO, Congress investigativearm, would stick by its original analysis that it costs thegovernment more to use certificates instead of cash in farmprice and income support programs, Reagan administrationsources said.    The GAO is expected to point out that use ofpaymentinkind, PIK, certificates has helped relieve tightstorage by moving grain that otherwise might not have beensold.    The testimony by Amstutz and GAO Senior Associate DirectorBrian Crowley comes as congressional budget committeesintensify their efforts to pinpoint ways to cut the federalbudget deficit  including considering limits on the use ofPIK certificates.    The CCC issues dollardenominated PIK certificates, orcerts, as a partial substitute for direct cash outlays tofarmers or cash subsidies to exporters. Certs can be used torepay nonrecourse loans or exchanged for CCC commodities orcash.    Between April and December 1986, CCC issued 3.8 billiondlrs worth of certificates, according to USDA. Up to another6.7 billion dlrs worth could be issued between January andAugust 1987, according to USDA.    Certs can cost the government more than cash primarilybecause recipients can use the certificates to pay backgovernment loans at levels below the loan rate.    Eliminating this practice, called PIK and roll, would savethe government 1.4 billion dlrs between 198892, according tothe Congressional Budget Office, CBO. That estimate, accordingto a CBO official, was based on an assumption that certificatescost the government about 15 pct more than cash payments.    The Senate and House Budget Committees are known to beconsidering curbs on PIKandroll transactions among othersavings alternatives.    The GAO last week reached the tentative conclusion that theestimated three billion dlrs of certificates redeemed to datehave cost the federal government between 150 mln and 600 mlndlrs, or between five and 20 pct, more than cash outlays, oneadministration official said.    However, the GAO has decided to reassess those estimatesbased in part on USDA criticism, department officials said.    The broad range of the cost estimate is partly attributableto the different effect certificates can have on market pricesover the course of a crop year.    USDAs Economic Research Service, for example, has foundthat between June and August last year, the 215 mln bushels ofcorn exchanged for certificates lowered the price of corn bybetween 35 and 45 cents per bushel.    Between September and November, however, certificates hadonly a marginal impact on corn prices, according to the ERSstudy, obtained by Reuters."

  "body": "Portuguese Prime Minister Anibal CavacoSilva said Portugal would hand back Macao to China on December20, 1999, but added the existing political, economic and socialsystem there would be maintained until the year 2050.    Cavaco Silva, speaking on national television hours beforethe initialling in Peking of an agreement on the handover, saidthat under the accord Macao would be a special administrativeregion of China and would have a large measure of autonomy.    Under the accord, Portuguese administration of theterritory would end on December 20, 1999 but the existingsystem there would be maintained until the year 2050, CavacoSilva said.    The existing way of life in Macao, the Portuguese laws,basically our political, economic and social system, willremain in force for a further 63 years from now, he said.    Cavaco Silva said he would go to Peking in the first halfof next month to formally sign the agreement with China, whichwould then be submitted to Portugals parliament for approval.    Cavaco Silva said that after Portuguese administration ofMacao formally ended in 1999, the future government of theterritory would enjoy complete autonomy except in the areas ofdefence and foreign relations. It would however be able to makeeconomic, trade and finance agreements with other countries.    The head of government would be named on the basis ofelections held for the post.    Macao would have an elected legislative assembly and anindependent judiciary. There would be religious freedom, a freepress and freedom of expression. The Portuguese language couldcontinue to be used in the government, assembly and courts.    Cavaco Silva said the current financial system wouldcontinue after the year 2000. The existing banks and freedom ofcapital movements would be maintained as would theconvertibility of the pataca as the territorys monetary unitand the legal protection of foreign investment.    Only the Macao government would be able to collect taxes.    Cavaco Silva said that those among Macaos 400,000population who held Portuguese nationality on the date of thehandover would thereafter continue to be able to use theirPortuguese passports and their nationality rights.    The nationality issue had been one of the points ofdisagreement in the complex handover talks.    The special administrative status to be granted to Macaoafter its handover mirrors a similar accord for the nearbyBritish colony of Hong Kong, which reverts back to Chinese rulein 1997 under a 1984 SinoBritish agreement."

The success of the program, launched late last year, meantthe government would be able to go beyond the 30 billion francfigure it estimated in its 1987 budget, he said in a televisioninterview.    About 75 pct of the additional revenue would be used to cutstate debt and 25 pct to provide additional funds for publicsector investment, he said.    Chirac said Finance Minister Edouard Balladur proposed tomake two billion francs of supplementary funding available fora five biillion franc accelerated motorway building program.    The remaining three billion francs for this would come froma motorway loan now in the domestic market.    Balladur also proposed to make some extra cash available tothe French national railways, SNCF, for the construction ofhighspeed rail track, and to boost research in the aerospaceindustry, he added.

  "body": "The United States remained isolated amongthe InterAmerican Development Banks 44 members as the Bankended its annual meeting here today without agreement on U.S.proposals to reform the regional lending institution.    The threeday meeting was dominated by the dispute and bythe failure of Brazil and its creditor banks to make anybreakthrough on debt talks after Brasilia suspended interestpayments last month.    Brazils Central Bank governor Francisco Gros said aftertalks with its 14bank advisory committee here yesterday thatit could not make a token interest payment now, as sought bybanks, but would maintain contact with the banks.    Delegates agreed to shelve discussion of IADB reforms untilthe halfyearly International Monetary Fund and World Bankmeetings in two weeks time in Washington at which a decisionwill be urgently sought in order to maintain credit flows tothe recessionhit region.    The Bank cannot maintain an adequate lending level unlessit is given increased resources, IADB president Antonio OrtizMena told a press conference.    Ortiz Mena said 42 countries opposed Washingtons proposalto lower veto power over loans to 35 pct of the Banks votingshares from a simple majority as at present.    U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker said Monday the UnitedStates, as 34.5 pct shareholder and provider of the bulk of theBanks resources, should have more say in approving loans andconditioned a nine billion dlr increase in its contribution onapproving the reforms.    But Ortiz Mena said Latin America and the nonregionalmembers including Europe and Japan had all supported a 40 pctveto level. Canada declined to state a position.    Behind the dispute was a U.S. attempt to radically changethe direction of the Bank, which has lent 35 billion dlrs toLatin America in its 28 years, and give it a bigger role in thecurrent debt strategy with increased lending but more stringentconditions attached.    But Ortiz said the Bank cannot divert too much of itsresources to socalled sectoral lending, whereby loans tospecific sectors are tied to economic reforms, because thiscould affect the Banks Triple A rating as a borrower in worldmarkets.    For this reason we have agreed to limit sectoral loans to25 pct of the total, leaving the rest for investment inprojects, he said.    Ortiz Mena earlier told the Banks closing session that asa result of negotiations here, the Bank can expect a newinjection of about 25 billion dlrs for the period 198790.    The United States has said it will only be able to supporta level close to the sixth replenishment of funds, which cameto 15.7 billion dlrs, unless its proposals are accepted.    But despite the impasse, some Latin American delegatesincluding Mexican Finance Minister Gustavo Petricioli said theywere optimistic a compromise agreement could be reached nextmonth."

Brasil last month suspended payments on a large part of its109billion dlr debt, the highest in the developing world.

  "body": "Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc saidWednesday its business is booming, despite its inability todistance itself from the insider trading scandal that hasspread rumors and doubts through Wall Street.    For a company thats supposed to be under siege, we aredoing extremely well. We are exceedingly profitable, aspokesman for the firm told Reuters.    The rumors that have swirled around Drexel, more than anyother broker, have involved concerns that its business will bethreatened by the Federal probe, say Wall Street sources. Thefirm has long been at the leading edge of the mergers businessand had ties to nowdisgraced speculator Ivan Boesky.    In the latest chapter of the story, Drexel said that somecommodities firms have begun to limit the amount of businessthey will do with the firm, citing credit risks. Drexel haslong been a powerful competitor in precious metals markets.    But Drexel spokesman Steve Anredder told Reuters thatDrexels overall business is proceeding normally and thefirstquarter profit could be the strongest of anybody on WallStreet.    I wouldnt say were not feeling any effect from thetrading probes, he said. But were doing extremely well.    The firm was among the first to be subpoenaed in thegovernments wideranging probe of illegal trading involvingthe use of confidential company information on Wall Street.    Believed to be under particular scrutiny was Drexels junkbond operation  the issuance of highrisk speculative debtthat it pioneered for financing corporate takeovers.    We have done nothing wrong, said the Drexel spokesman.After a thorough investigation, we have found no evidence ofany wrongdoing by the firm or anyone within the firm.    The spokesman said that in the aftermath of the Boeskyarrest, Drexel had not been charged. Nor had any individual atthe firm been charged with illegal acts while employed byDrexel. One of its top merger specialists, Martin Siegel, wascharged in connection with a former job.    Still, more than any other firm on Wall Street, Drexel hassuffered the consequences of the insider trading probe. Tobegin with, there have been a series of brief shocks in thejunk bond market, in nervousness linked to rumors that Drexelmight be in trouble.    At one point, Drexel said Wednesday, a large Midwest bankrefused to allow Drexelissued bonds as collateral on creditlines. Two weeks ago, the restriction was withdrawn, it said.    The company also was notified last month that the outsideinsurer of Drexels individual brokerage accounts had decidednot to renew coverage. Drexel has set up its own subsidiaryhandling part of the insurance. American International Groupand a group of British underwriters have handled the rest.    Drexel also appears to have lost ground to others in themergers and acquisition business recently, market sources said.However, Anredder said that there was no sign that Drexel hadlost any customers at all owing to the insider trading cases.But in citing results for the quarter, the company pointsmostly to other areas of success.    Corporate financings have totaled 8 billion dlrs, including3 billion dlrs in new junk bonds in the JanuaryMarch period,Drexel said. Drexel maintains the lions share of thislucrative business, trade sources noted.    The market for junk bonds, although jittery, has ralliedback with a vengeance, Anredder said.    Although they see new competition in the junk bond arena,market sources concur that Drexel remains king of the hill.    While some of the leading Wall Street firms were limitingheadtohead dealings with Drexel in the commodity markets based on worries over the credit of the company, the Drexelspokesman called this ridiculous."

Mulligan said the cooperative would continue operatinguntil April 24, when the member cooperatives will have to beginclearing their futures trades through other companies.    Mulligan said one of the members, Farmers Commodities ofDes Moines, Iowa, was attempting to organize a new cooperativeto replace Illinois Coop as a clearing company.    Sources close to Farmers Commodities confirmed its plans,but Hal Richards, president, could not be reached immediatelyfor comment, and it was unknown how many cooperatives might bewilling to band together.    Industry sources said Farmers Commodities would face adifficult task in setting up a new clearing organization byApril 24, the day Illinois Cooperative will be dissolved.    They would have to obtain commitments from a sufficientnumber of cooperatives to meet minimum capital requirements,obtain trading memberships, and set up the office mechanisms tohandle futures trading.    In the meantime, commercial clearing firms have beencourting the individual coops, trying to obtain their businesswith low trading rates.    If Farmers Commodities is unable to set up a clearingorganization by April 24, individual members will find otherhomes, and theyre unlikely to change clearing firms a secondtime, one industry source said.    The demise of Illinois Coop was set in motion by thewithdrawl of Growmark, Inc., the largest member with more than70 pct of the capital stock, according to sources within thecooperative.    Mulligan acknowledged prior to the vote that Growmark hadno need to belong to the cooperative since it became affiliatedlast year with Archer Daniels Midland.    But he said Illinois Cooperative would still have been ableto meet minimum capital requirements without Growmark.    The vote to dissolve the organization was met with acertain amount of pang, he said. But in the final analysis,the decision has to be economic, not emotional."

Leahy said he would be delighted to have freshman Sen. JohnBreaux DLa. join the committee.

Baker was quoted on British Television over the weekend assaying he has no target for the U.S. currency, a statement thattriggered this weeks renewed decline of the dollar.    I think the Paris agreement represents evidence thatinternational economic policy coordination is alive and well,Baker said.    The Treasury Secretary stressed however it was veryimportant for the main surplus countries to grow as fast asthey could consistent with low inflation to resolve tradeimbalances.    He added that Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volckerhas also been very outspoken in suggesting main tradingpartners grow as fast as they can.    Baker noted that the Jcurve, the delayed beneficial effectof a weakening of a currency on that countrys trade balance,takes 12 to 18 months to work its way through to the tradedeficit and it is now 18 months since the Plaza agreement tolower the dollars value.

  "body": "China posted a budget deficit of 7.08billion yuan in 1986, the fourth highest since 1949, after asurplus of 2.82 billion in 1985, Finance Minister Wang Bingqiantold the National Peoples Congress.    He put 1986 revenue at 222.03 billion yuan, against abudgeted 214.17 billion, and up from 185.41 billion in 1985,and expenditure at 229.11 billion, against a budgeted 214.17billion and 182.59 billion in 1985.    Official figures show the record post1949 budget deficitwas 17 billion yuan in 1979.    Wang said the 1986 deficit was due to excess capitalconstruction and administrative expenses and unjustified andextravagant investments outside the state plan.    He also blamed the inefficiency of firms whose productioncosts and losses rose. He said subsidising state firms lossescost 32.25 billion yuan. The 1985 budget did not give aseparate figure for this.    He said the processing industry developed too fast and someprojects could not start operations because of power shortages,while too many nonproductive facilities were set up.    Wang said 1986 and 1985 investment in fixed assets rose15.3 pct and 41.8 pct respectively year on year and consumptionfunds rose 12.5 pct and 23.7 pct, outstripping the growth innational income.    Wang said revenues were affected by the steep fall in worldoil prices, the decline in the price of primary products, adrop in income from customs duties and the rising cost ofearning foreign exchange through exports.    Revenue also fell because the state raised the rate ofdepreciation for fixed assets of certain state firms, reducedtheir regulatory tax and made other tax cuts for firms.    Wang said 1986 tax receipts rose to 206.45 billion yuanfrom 201.82 billion in 1985, state treasury bond receipts to6.2 billion from 6.04 billion and receipts from foreign loansrose to 7.87 billion from 2.5 billion.    He said 1986 budgetary spending on capital constructionrose to 65.57 billion yuan from 56.97 billion in 1985, ontechnical renovation and new products to 12.62 billion from10.05 billion, aid to rural production and other farm expensesto 12.03 billion from 10.16 billion, culture, science,education and public health to 38 billion from 31.72 billionand defence to 20.13 billion from 19.15 billion.     Wang said expenditure for repaying principal and intereston foreign loans in 1986 was 3.4 billion yuan, up from 3.26billion in 1985. REUTER3"

Guyanas arrears to the International Monetary Fund IMFare now 70 mln dlrs and it would not be eligible for new loansin the near future, Greenidge told Reuters during theInterAmerican Development Bank IADB annual meeting here. MORE    Greenidge also said a World Bank mission would visitGeorgetown this week to assess prospects for a rescue plan thatwould enable Guyana to revive its economy. But he said thegovernment does not expect to be able to reduce its arrearsthis year.    Arrears to the IMF and the World Bank are projected to riseto 100 mln dlrs by the end of 1987. About 90 mln dlrs of this,equivalent to nearly half Guyanas annual exports, would beowed to the IMF.    Expecting us to pay arrears is like asking a dying man togive a pint of blood, Greenidge said.    But Greenidge said Guyana has taken steps to reduce itsfiscal deficit, which now amounts to 65 pct of GDP. It hasincreased taxes, reduced public expenditure and refinanced itsinternal debt.    He said the World Bank would meanwhile look at investmentrequirements for potential exportearning projects such as goldmining, timber, oil and kaolin.    Because of its arrears, Guyana has been unable to draw downa 40 mln dlr World Bank loan for a bauxite industryrehabilitation project.

One analyst did say, however, that the removal of fixedcommissions on transactions in government securities and Asiancurrency bonds would increase trading volume, because mostdeals before were transacted directly between clients.    One change will allow stockbroking firms to advertise, butbrokers said this would not have much effect because mostcorporate clients already know the market well.    Many remisiers brokers agents and dealers criticised theexchange for not taking the opportunity to abolish or cuttransfer fees on remisiers moving to other firms.    One remisier said the transfer fees inhibit an efficientbroking system because they restrict brokers movements.    But most remisiers welcomed the amendment to replace cashdeposits with bank guarantees for business transactions. Wherean extra deposit is needed, it can in future be either in cashor in securities approved by the exchange.    Other remisiers felt the new rule that they must report alltransactions involving 50,000 dlrs or more to the exchange wasunnecessary.

  "body": "The latest round of talks betweenPhilippine officials and the countrys commercial bankcreditors on the rescheduling of 9.4 billion dlrs worth of debtare still proceeding, but with a narrower focus, PhilippineFinance Secretary Jaime Ongpin said.    He told a press briefing Wednesday that Manila has droppeda twotier interest payment offer, which would have given banksa higher return if they took partial payment in new Philippineinvestment notes PINs instead of in cash.    The PINs proposal has been laid aside.... The discussion isnow on pricing of just the cash payments, he said.    Foreign banking sources in Manila said on Tuesday that thePhilippines had raised its basic interest rate offer to 78over the London interbank offered rate LIBOR but Ongpin wouldnot discuss details of the pricing negotiations.    He also refused to speculate on when an overall agreementmight be reached. The talks have been going on for more thanthree weeks.    Manila originally offered to pay interest in cash at 58over LIBOR or in a mixture of cash and PINs  tradeable,dollardenominated, zero coupon notes that could potentiallyyield up to one point over LIBOR.    The PINs option was subsequently modified to guarantee atleast a 78 point spread over LIBOR but many bankers still hadgrave reservations, seeing it as a possible precedent for otherlarge debtors to avoid paying interest in cash.    The PINs proposal has now been left on the table as aseparate option for those banks, which might want to fund theirown investments in the Philippines or sell the notes in thesecondary market, Ongpin said.    Under Manilas plan, the PINs would be redeemable at fullface value in Philippine pesos to fund local equity investmentsat any time prior to their sixyear maturity date.    While the commercial banks had their doubts about the PINsproposal, Ongpin said there was great interest on the part ofcertain investment banks which are already active in thesecondary market for sovereign debt.    Unlike current debtequity schemes, Ongpin said, the PINswould include no government fees and would be free fromadministrative hassles.    He said about six investment banks had been approached andfour had replied so far. One even showed interest in buying 45mln dlrs worth of notes, he said.    Ongpin said that by funding current interest payments inthe secondary market through the PINs scheme, the Philippinescould conserve at least one to 1.5 billion dlrs of foreignexchange reserves during its planned sevenyear restructuringperiod.

  "body": "Hong Kongs government has long keptintervention in the economy to a minimum in the belief thatwhen it comes to business, businessmen generally know best.    But the government is slowly being forced to take a moreactive economic role, partly to face the challenge from fastgrowing economies like South Korea and Taiwan and economicpowerhouse Japan, businessmen said.    The government announced this month it will spend six mlnH.K. Dlrs over the next two years to encourage electronicsfirms to send engineers for training overseas.    The engineers will learn design of application specificintegrated circuits ASIC used in products ranging frompersonal computers to hightechnology toys that talk.    The government has funded vocational training before butthis will be its first such program aimed at bringing backadvanced technology from overseas.    Government officials told Reuters that other areas in theelectronics sector are being considered for similar treatment.    Hong Kongs key electronics industry last year accountedfor exports of 61 billion H.K. Dlrs, though the total includessales of electrical machinery and other items.    Officials said that this key sector, second only totextiles in terms of exports, needs high technologies alreadyavailable in neighbouring economies if it is to compete.    Belatedly, we realize there are some technologies whichcant be taught here, said K.Y. Yeung, Director of Industry.    A study by U.S. Research firm Dataquest Inc last yearshowed that Hong Kongs share of U.S. Consumer electronicimports had fallen to 3.5 pct in 1985 from 6.4 pct in 1983.    South Korea, Taiwan and Japan all take a more active rolein guiding economic development and policy makers are worriedthat perhaps some assistance  albeit limited  is needed.    This is perceived to be an area of development for HongKong, said Lawrence Mills, directorgeneral of the Federationof Hong Kong Industries. Many industrialists think governmentshould be more actively concerned with this area.    Hong Kong likes to call its policy positivenonintervention, meaning that it helps industry mainly bymaintaining economic stability and ensuring that needed roadsand harbour facilities are in place.    It offers no special tax incentives for foreign investors,believing that its low corporate profits tax of 18 pct andpersonal income tax of 16.5 pct are sufficient.    But the government has been forced to gradually take a moreactive role in the economy. In the last three years it hasstepped in to aid seven problem banks, taking over three ofthem, to protect depositors whose funds were not insured.    It has also expanded the powers of its banking andsecurities commissions to police these key economic sectors.    Industry officials said manufacturers need help acquiringexpensive new technology, especially when returns on investmentare years away. This is only a small start but it will helpmake this technology more readily available, said an engineerwith a major U.S. Electronics firm in Hong Kong.    Texas Instruments Inc TXN and Motorola Inc MOT of theU.S. And Japans Toshiba Corp TSBA.T already conduct ASICdesign work in Hong Kong, while a handful of firms havecommitted funds for capitalintensive production.    Under the industry department program, companies would befunded to train engineers overseas but those employees would berequired to apply their new skills locally for an as yetunspecified period.    We want to promote ASIC design and eventually production inHong Kong, said Yeung of the Industry Department.    Some industrialists said it will take more than a trainingprogram to keep electronics manufacturers competitive in theyears ahead. Government officials said most manufacturers inthe industry are small scale, employing fewer than 100 people.    These firms will not be able to afford expensive technologydevelopment programs, industry officials said.    The program has raised concerns that government may one dayveer too far from its policy of minimal intervention. Theyvereached the right decision, said Mills of the Federation ofIndustries. But the fear among some firms is it might be aslippery slope towards interference. REUTER3"

  "title": "ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT  TOKYO EARTHQUAKE AFTERSHOCKS",
  "body": "The possibility that a major earthquakewill strike Tokyo, causing corporate and financial ruin, hauntsthe worst nightmares of many insurers and bankers polled byReuters.    The Japanese capital is shaken by hundreds of small tremorsevery year, but last weeks biq quake in western Japan, whichmeasured 6.9 on the openended Richter scale, was a timelyreminder that the big one could come at any time.    Another on Tuesday registering a preliminary 6.5 on thescale struck the Sea of Japan coast northwest of Tokyo.    A widely accepted theory by the late seismologist KawasumiHiroshi states that major quakes occur in cycles averaging 69years. Tokyo was last laid flat in 1923 by a tremor reading7.8, raising the spectre of another within five years.    Seismic experts at Shizuoka, one of three areas near Tokyoconsidered quakeprone, say they expect a major earthquakewithin the next few years.    Added to such fears is the fact that no developed nationhas suffered a major quake since the farreaching changes inthe last two decades which have bound the global economy into acomplex, fragile, interdependent financial network.    We are reaching a dangerous time. Insurance companies arestarting to worry about how to cover the large losses, saidHatsuho Narita, a manager at the British Insurance Group.    Its a theme that has worried a lot of people. Itsdifficult to put a figure on it, but the impact on all worldmarkets would be considerable, Brian Waterhouse, a bankingexpert at brokerage James Capel in Tokyo, told Reuters.    What would happen    Consider that Tokyo and its six surrounding prefecturesaccount for up to 40 pct of Japanese gross national product, orsome six pct of world GNP.    Some economists believe that in the immediate aftermath ofa Tokyo quake, the yen would rise against sterling because ofthe large amount of reinsurance which would fall due in London.But it would plunge against other currencies.    This would worsen the dramatic loss of value in land andassets in the Tokyo area. Banks would be left holding hundredsof billions of dollars in worthless mortgages and loans.    Bankers estimate that 50 to 70 pct of city and regionalbanks loan exposure is to smaller business, which would mostlikely lose all in a quake. Up to nine pct of their exposure isin housing and consumer loans, they said.    Many smaller banks and some larger ones would go to thewall, bankers polled by Reuters said.    The government, aware that insurance claims would be huge,has set a payout ceiling of 10 mln yen per private house. InTokyo, 100 mln yen buys only a very modest residence.    In addition, the insurance industry has formed the JapanEarthquake Reinsurance Co to cover housing to a total of 10billion dlrs, 80 pct of it governmentguaranteed.    However, insurers said the industrial sector, which has nogovernment backing, is a more dangerous risk.    Japanese insurers said they are finding it increasinglydifficult to find reinsurance abroad.    Overseas firms are now very alert to earthquake insurancerisks, said Tahashi Kumakiri, Foreign Department head at theJapan Nonlife Insurance Association.    Due to limited world insurance capacity, the FinanceMinistry recommends a coverage limit of 15 to 30 pct ofJapanese firms total insurable value.    Even so, one insurer believes that local firms reinsure upto 80 pct of their quake cover overseas, most of it throughLloyds of London.    Some of this reinsurance is then reinsured again,compounding the risks should the money suddenly be called in.    Foreign entities in Japan are allowed 100 pct quake coverbut foreign insurers now set a limit of 60 pct.    Industrial cover is confidential but official figures showthat in fiscal 198586 ended March 31, Japan did about half abillion dlrs of overseas reinsurance business in fire cover,most of which is quakerelated.    Bankers said the destruction of underlying assets andrepatriation of huge amounts of Japanese overseas investmentwould seriously affect overseas stock and bond markets.    Japanese institutions buy a net 10 billion dlrs or so offoreign bonds a month, much of it U.S. Treasuries, and arepurchasing more and more U.S. And European stocks. The value offoreign holdings of Japanese securities would nosedive.    Japan would need huge amounts of money over a long periodto rebuild, which would block out developing nation creditorsfrom existing capital resources, the bankers said.    Loss of central computers would mean billions in losttransactions, bankers noted.    Oil traders said crude prices would plummet as imports fellby up to half from some three mln barrels per day now.

He said that because of financial difficulties, the statecannot increase spending on culture, education, science andpublic health in 1987 at the same rate as over the past fewyears. Expenditure in those sectors will rise by two pct.    The only allocations not to be affected by the general 10pct cutback are subsidies for price rises, repayment ofprincipal and interest on domestic and foreign loans, funds forthe disabled and spending for other social relief.    Wang said state firms must cut their total losses by 30 pctfrom the 1986 level, overhead expenses by 10 pct and rawmaterial consumption by two pct. Commercial firms must cuttheir deficits by 20 pct and running costs by two pct.    He said violations of financial and economic discipline arecommon, including tax evasion, false accounting, embezzlement,theft, extravagance and accepting and offering bribes. Suchpractices have reached very serious proportions in some areas,departments and units and must be dealt with seriously, hesaid.    Wang said 11.4 billion yuan worth of foreign loans havebeen arranged according to the 198690 plan, with 3.2 billiongoing to pay for foreign equipment in the Baoshan steel plantnear Shanghai.    He said China is running no risk in using more foreignloans, provided it prepares careful feasibility studies,borrows only what it can repay and uses the loans only todevelop production in priority sectors.    Wang said China plans to levy new taxes on the use ofarable land for nonfarm purposes starting this year. Half therevenue generated will go to the state and half to localitiesto be used in the development of agriculture.    The only new spending is 11 billion yuan to be used tocover tax reductions and increased subsidies for big andmediumsize state firms and textile and other light industries.The money will also pay for increases in the state purchasingprices of some grain, cotton and oilyielding crops, he said.

  "title": "BP TO OFFER 7.4 BILLION DLRS FOR STANDARD SHARES",
  "body": "British Petroleum Co Plc BP.L said itintended to make a tender offer for the 45 pct of Standard OilCo SRD.N it does not already own at 70 dlrs a share cash, fora total of 7.4 billion if the offer is fully accepted.    The offer would be made through its BP North America Incunit and was intended to commence not later than April 1. Theoffer would not be conditional on any minimum number of sharesbeing tendered.    BP said in a statement the 70 dlr a share price was basedon its own valuation as well as those of its financialadvisers. It took into account reviews of both public andnonpublic information.    Standard closed in New York last night at 6478 dlrs, down134 dlrs.    BP shares dropped on the announcement to 877p from 888p atlast nights close.    About a third of the cash payable would be met from BPsown resources.    The remainder would come from new borrowings, partly frombanks under a fouryear committed revolving credit facility andpartly from a a new U.S. Dlr commercial paper programme. Thecompany said it was in the course of arranging thesefacilities.    BP Chairman Sir Peter Walters said that the groupsinvestment in Standard was its largest single asset. Fullownership would enable investment and operating decisions to bemade without the limitations of a minority interest.    BP also believed the acquisition represented the optimumuse of its financial resources. It was confident oil priceswere likely to remain within a range sufficient to justify theinvestment.    Walters added that it also felt that, due to managementchanges in 1986, Standard could now operate successfully evenin a lower oil price environment.    Standards net assets at end1986 were 7.02 billion dlrsand in the year it reported a loss of 1.08 billion dlrs beforetax and before an extraordinary item of 608 mln dlrs.    Analysts said that the move by BP had come as a surprise.One noted that it was not immediately clear why the groupshould spend so much money buying a company it alreadycontrolled.    BP could also have bought up the remainder of Standardshares considerably cheaper had it moved six months ago.    It was also unclear what effect the tender would have onthe U.K. Governments recent announcement that it intended todispose of its remaining 31.7 pct stake in BP sometime in the198788 financial year, analysts said.    Analyst Paul Spedding of brokers Kleinwort Grieveson notedthat any effect on the government sale of its stake in BP woulddepend on the reaction of the markets.    The deal would probably push BPs gearing up to around 59pct from 20 pct currently, he said.    However, with the likelihood that oil prices would notrepeat last years rapid drop the prospects for Standardreturning to profitability this year  and BP benefitting fromits cash flow  were good.    Standard was a high cost oil producer, the analysts noted.    Spedding noted that it needed about 12 dlrs a barrel tomake money, and at about 15 dlrs a barrel revenue fromproduction and its downstream activities would push itcomfortably into surplus.    BP initially took a stake in Standard following thediscovery of oil in Alaskas Prudhoe bay in 1969. BP hadinadequate distribution facilities in the U.S. While Standard,which was strong on marketing and refining, was short on crudeoil.    The analysts said that BP had promoted a major managementreorganisation of Standard in the past year.    The probability that much of the shakeup at Standard wasnow complete was one possible factor behind the timing of thetender offer, Spedding said.    BPs willingness to take hard decisions such as majorbalance sheet write offs and the sale of assets had been wellreceived in the markets.    The lower costs that should now be possible  especiallyafter the rationalisation of the loss making minerals division should allow the benefits of an oil price recovery to comestraight through to 1987 profits without being cut back byother sectors.

  "title": "HOECHST RAISES PROFITS ON LOWER SALES",
  "body": "Hoechst AG HFAG.F said in astatement it increased its pretax profits in 1986 despite afall in turnover due to lower foreign sales.    The lower sales were due to the fall in the dollar andother currencies against the mark. Other factors were pressureon selling prices because of a sharp fall in the prices ofcrude oil and petrochemical raw materials and the sale ofpolystyrene business in the U.S. And Netherlands.    World group pretax profit rose to 3.21 billion marks in1986 from 3.16 billion in 1985, with sales falling to 38.01billion from 42.72 billion.    Within group turnover, foreign sales fell to 27.18 billionmarks in 1986 from 31.92 billion in 1985, a drop of 14.9 pct.    The statement made no mention of net profit figures.Hoechst will announce its dividend proposal on April 23.    In the first quarter of this year sales were hit by thecold weather at the start of the year. If the dollar continuesat present low levels, 1987 sales will again be below theprevious year, although in volume terms they are unchanged from1986, Hoechst said.    Sales of paints and dyes, fibres, sheeting and informationtechnology all rose in 1986 but plant construction sales fell.    Hoechst attributed its good results to the performance ofthe parent company, other units in West Germany, and toAmerican Hoechst Corp.    Improved earnings in the U.S. Largely reflected therestructuring of styrene and polystyrene activities.    Roussel Uclaf RUCF.PA and most domestic nonconsolidatedpartners did not perform as well as in 1985.    Hoechst attributed the 12 pct rise in parent company pretaxprofits to 1.82 billion marks above all to a rise in earningsfrom interest and holdings in other companies, and a fall inextraordinary costs.    The fall in raw material prices was not enough tocompensate for the decline in turnover due to lower prices andcurrencies, Hoechst said.    The bulk of the 2.53 billion marks investment in newprojects, up from 294 mln marks in 1985, went on the capitalincrease of Hoechst Capital Corp in connection with theacquisition of Celanese Corp.    Celanese was merged with American Hoechst in February toform Hoechst Celanese Corp. REUTER3"

  "body": "Australias largest company, The BrokenHill Pty Co Ltd BRKN.S BHP, is expected to report a netprofit of around 600 mln to 620 mln dlrs tomorrow for the firstnine months ended February 28, share analysts polled by Reuterssaid.    This would be well below the 813.0 mln dlrs earned in thefirst three quarters of 198586. In the full year ended May 311986 the group earned a record 988.2 mln dlrs.    The analysts estimated that the group would report a thirdquarter net in the region of 200 mln to 220 mln dlrs, against238.6 mln a year earlier and 220.3 mln in the second quarter.    BHPs earnings in the first half ended November 30 amountedto 397.0 mln dlrs, sharply down from 589.3 mln a year earlier.    The analysts predicted that BHP will report an upturn inpetroleum earnings compared with the first quarter, reflectingsome improvement in crude oil prices from the Bass Straitfields, but these gains would be offset by lower mineral andsteel earnings.    They said the mineral group has been hit by lower coalprices and shipments to Japan while the steel division has beenaffected by industrial and production problems.    The analysts noted that the third quarter is normally BHPslowestearning period owing to a number of seasonal factors,and they predicted a sharp rise in fourth quarter net to around300 mln dlrs.    One key factor in the fourth quarter is expected to be atax break of some 70 mln dlrs for the investment allowance oncapital expenditure in the steel division, they said.    They said they saw BHPs full year earnings at around 900mln to 920 mln dlrs. They added that such a decline from198586 would be no surprise, noting BHP has said that it wouldbe difficult to equal its record 198586 net profit. REUTER3"

  "body": "West Germanys current accountsurplus widened to a provisional 6.6 billion marks in Februaryfrom a slightly downwards revised 4.8 billion in January, aspokeswoman for the Federal Statistics Office said.    The trade surplus in February widened to a provisional 10.4billion marks from 7.2 billion in January, she added.    The Statistics Office had originally put the Januarycurrent account surplus at 4.9 billion marks.    The February trade surplus was well up on the 6.84 billionmark surplus posted in the same month of 1986. But the currentaccount surplus was down slightly from the 6.85 billion surplusrecorded in February 1986.    A Statistics Office statement said the widening of theFebruary current account surplus compared with January was dueto seasonal factors. Neither the trade nor current accountfigures are seasonally adjusted.    February imports, measured in terms of value, totalled32.11 billion marks, a decline of 10 pct against February 1986but a rise of 5.5 pct against January.    Exports in February, also in value terms, totalled 42.56billion marks, 0.5 pct less than in February 1986 but up 13 pctcompared with January.    The Statistics Office said it was not yet able to calculatethe real change in exports and imports in February. But forcomparison purposes it noted that in January the average valueof imports had fallen 15 pct yearonyear while the averagevalue of exports had declined by only 4.4 pct.    Within the current account, the services account had 300mln marks deficit, supplementary trade items a 200 mln marksurplus while transfer payments posted a 3.7 billion markdeficit.    Taking the first two months of 1987 together, imports invalue terms fell 14 pct to 62.6 billion marks compared with ayear earlier. The value of exports totalled 80.2 billion marks,a decline of 7.4 pct against the same months of 1986.    The resulting trade surplus of 17.6 billion marks forJanuaryFebruary compares with a cumulative surplus of 14.1billion marks in the yearago period.    The cumulative current account surplus for January andFebruary 1987 totalled 11.3 billion marks against 11.4 billionmarks a year earlier, the Statistics Office said.    Bank economists said the rise in the February trade surplusreflected an improvement in the terms of trade as well asseasonal factors. The Federal Statistics Office said earlierthis week that February import prices fell 0.7 pct againstJanuary while export prices were unchanged.    The rise in the nominal figures masks a lower export trendthat is not expected to change for several months at least,said an economist. He said the nominal trade surplus for 1987as a whole is likely to fall only slightly from the record112.2 billion marks in 1986 but other economists said thesurplus could fall to around 80 billion marks.    An economist at the Bank fuer Gemeinwirtschaft BfG inFrankfurt said a twomonth comparison of trade figures gave amore accurate picture of West Germanys trade position.    He noted the 17.6 billion mark surplus for January andFebruary together was lower than the 21.6 billion mark surplusposted in November and December.    The trend is clearly lower, he said.    This economist, who declined to be named, said the Februaryrise was also partly explained by special factors in January,when there had been a number of public holidays as well asextremely cold weather, both of which hindered trade.

  "body": "Japans plan to cut beef interventionprices for the fiscal year starting April 1 will not boostdemand because of strict supply controls and a complexdistribution system, Japanese and U.S. Industry sources said.    Government beef policy protects farmers rather than meetingconsumers demands and the cutback ... Is too marginal, aHousewives Association of Japan official said.    Despite mounting U.S. Pressure on Japan to open farmmarkets, beef is strictly controlled by the government, whichmaintains a price stabilisation zone to protect farmers.    Under the plan, expected to be announced this month, thestandard or bottom price of castrated wagyu  known as marbledbeef  will be set at 1,370 yen per kilo for 198788 against1,400 now, and the ceiling at 1,780 yen against 1,820.    The standard price of other beef, mainly produced fromdairy steers, is set at 1,020 yen against 1,090 and the ceilingat 1,325 against 1,420.    Ministry officials said the semigovernment LivestockIndustry Promotion Corp LIPC conducts buffer stock operationsto help keep wholesale beef prices within the interventionprice zone.    The LIPC is allowed to import most beef, with the amountset by the government under a quota system. When wholesaleprices go above the ceiling, the LIPC releases its beef stocks,both domestic and imported, and buys locally produced beef whenprices are below.    But the LIPC has often been criticised for releasing beefstocks when the prices are higher than the ceiling.    Phillip Seng, Asian Director of the U.S. Meat ExportFederation, told Reuters the two pct cut in prices is a steptoward closing the gap with European Community prices, abouthalf those in Japan.    But Seng said the cut will not benefit consumers or U.S.Meat exporters because of Japans rigid and complicateddistribution system and strict supply control by the LIPC.    The Housewives Association official said retail beef pricesare high mainly because of distribution problems and highproduction costs, as well as poor operations by the LIPC.    American meat packers see Japan as a promising market. F.C.Beatty, of U.S. Packer John Morrell and Co, told the JapanTimes beef cuts, which sell for 1.20 to 3.00 dlrs a pound inthe U.S., Are sold at 15 to 30 dlrs in Japan.

But industry sources said it is unclear how much demandwill pick up if retail beef prices drop following any sharpreduction in intervention prices.    U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said this week hewill ask Japan to remove all beef import restrictions when hevisits here next month.    In 1984, Japan decided to increase its beef import quota by9,000 tonnes a year until March 31, 1988.    In 198788, the quota will rise to 177,000 tonnes from168,000 in 198687, ministry officials said, adding Japan wantsto keep selfsufficiency in beef at around 70 pct. REUTER3"

  "title": "PHILIPPINES TO PUT 100 STATE FIRMS UP FOR SALE",
  "body": "The head of a Philippine panel chargedwith selling the nonperforming assets of government financialinstitutions said some 100 stateowned companies would also beput up for privatisation.    But David SyCip, chief executive trustee of the AssetPrivatisation Trust APT, told a meeting of financialexecutives the APT has not yet received a list of the firms.    I believe lead investor groups, people who see longtermpotential, are willing to buy such companies in full and do ahandson job of running them, SyCip said.    SyCip said open bidding would be used to sell all assetshandled by the APT. He said bidding would be eitheropenpriced, if there were enough serious contenders, or theAPT would set a target price for acquisition. He added that thetarget price did not constitute a rigid floor.    What we consider an acceptable price is a price at which aninvestor will earn an adequate return, he said.    SyCip said the bulk of the APTs current work relates tothe nonperforming assets of the stateowned Development Bankof the Philippines DBP and the Philippine National BankPNB. The APT was set up in January.    SyCip said about 75 pct of the 400odd assets that the DBPand the PNB are handing over to the APT are still in the formof financial assets.    In some cases financial assets have been converted intophysical assets by foreclosures. They are fairly cut and driedbecause we are dealing with mostly whole production facilitieslike textile or foodprocessing plants, he said.    Financial assets are more complicated. The only recourse isto foreclose, gain titles, and try to sell the asset, but thelaws here tend to favour the debtors, he added.    SyCip said although the APT is protected from prosecutionby its charter, many debtors are tying up the panel withlitigation.    If you see some of the situations we have to work our waythrough you will see that our symbol, a Gordian knot, is an aptillustration, he said.    SyCip said the PNB has not succeeded in foreclosing on 16of the 17 sugar factories it wants to sell because of the highcosts involved. When you do your arithmetic you realise that ifyou did foreclose your recovery would be only a fraction of theassets book exposure, he said.    SyCip said the APT was not worried about whether associatesof former President Ferdinand Marcos, who originally owned manyof the bankrupt companies, would buy them back through theprivatisation scheme.    We just look at the bottom line, which is to monetise theseassets to the maximum degree possible, he said. We are sellingfor cash, it is not our concern where it comes from.    He said he had told cabinet ministers sceptical about theidentities of buyers that Marcos cronies could easily put uplegitimate fronts if they were specifically barred from biddingfor assets on the block.    I told them if I am paid 20 mln pesos in 100peso bills,all with identical serial numbers and they look like genuinelegal currency, then I would accept them, SyCip said.    He said some participants in the governments debtequityswap scheme were interested in buying nonperforming assetswith the pesos they receive from such deals. The problem isgovernment regulations slow down approval of debtequity plansand the APT normally demands full payment within 15 days.    The Central Bank and Monetary Board could also look atinvestment funds earmarked for nonperforming asset purchases,he said. It would greatly facilitate matters.    SyCip said last month the APT hoped to recover about 24billion pesos of the assets total worth of 108 billion.    President Corazon Aquino announced earlier this month thatproceeds from the sale of APTcontrolled assets would be usedto finance the governments land reform program, which aims todistribute about 9.7 mln hectares of land to poor peasants.    Asked why the APT did not favour Filipino buyers, SyCipsaid How much money has the country to lose because of thisFilipinos first slogan How many people have becomemillionaires and then forgotten the Philippines and put theirmoney in the United States or Australia REUTER3"

  "title": "SINGAPORE LAWS TO LIBERALISE LOCAL CAPITAL MARKET",
  "body": "Parliament passed laws increasing theamounts and frequency of treasury bill issues and allowing thegovernment to raise up to 35 billion dlrs through issues ofregistered stock, bearer bonds and bookentry securities.    Both steps are aimed at establishing a wider domesticcapital market as part of Singapores plans to expand itsfinancial sector, Finance Minister Richard Hu said.    Banking sources said the new government securities market,scheduled to have been launched on March 2, had been delayedpending legislative approval of these bills.    The 35 billion dlrs maximum which may be raised under theDevelopment Loan Bill 1987, against a ceiling of 15 billionunder current laws, is expected to satisfy demand forgovernment securities over the next four years, Hu said.    He said 6.1 billion dlrs of the 15 billion has so far beenraised as development loans. The rest will be used up whenbonds are issued to absorb advance deposits of 13.9 billiondlrs from the Central Provident Fund CPF, a mandatory pensionsavings scheme. Workers and employers contribute a respective25 pct and 10 pct of a workers salary to the CPF, which hadfunds totalling 29.3 billion at end1986.    Regular government securities issues are needed to meet thedemand of banks, insurance companies, other financialinstitutions and corporate and individual investors, Hu said.    The Monetary Authority of Singapore MAS had said itplanned to launch trading by issuing taxable instrumentsgrossing seven billion dlrs in the first year and a gross 38billion dlrs of paper over the next five years.    Funds raised in excess of the governments budgetary needswill not be channelled into increased spending, but will berecycled back to the financial system, largely through the MAS,Hu said.    Hu said the current government securities market isrudimentary, with the CPF holding threequarters of theoutstanding debt and banks, discount houses and insurancecompanies holding the rest. The concentration of securities inthe hands of such longterm holders has left little scope fortrading activity, he said.    Moreover, the maturity of the bonds, mostly 20 years, wasnot attractive to other investors who might have been expectedto deal more actively in the market. The infrequency of bondissues exacerbated the lack of liquidity necessary for thedevelopment of a market, Hu said.    Hu said these obstacles have been resolved and regularissues of government securities will be made, initiallycarrying terms of up to five years and marketrelated yields.    The minimum denomination is 1,000 dlrs for notes and bonds aimed at individual investors  and 10,000 dlrs for thetreasury bills, which are directed at corporate investors.    Eight primary and registered dealers have undertaken tomake markets in order to ensure liquidity, he said.    Hu said while the new government securities market will beessentially domestic, nonresidents are free to invest, butinterest earned will be subject to withholding tax.    Hu said under the new Treasury Bills Amendment Bill, allbook entries of borrowings through treasury bill issues must bemade in records maintained by MAS.    Hu said that instead of physical certificates having totravel back and forth at each transaction, with side trips tothe MAS for registration, the MAS will maintain a computerisedsystem for updating records in a central register.    Commercial banks and primary and registered governmentsecurities dealers will each have two securities accounts withthe MAS, one for their own holdings and the other for holdingson behalf of all their customers, Hu said.    All trades will be reflected daily in changes in theseaccounts, Hu said.    These institutions will in turn act as custodians ofgovernment securities for their customers, rendering each anindividual accounting of his holdings.    Hu said the new system will cut storage and handling costsand paper work, reduce the danger of loss, theft, destructionand counterfeiting, and permit greater speed and efficiency inhandling large volumes of transactions.

  "body": "World group turnover of Siemens AGSIEG.F should rise to 51 or 52 billion marks in the currentyear to September 31 after a 19 pct upturn in the first fivemonths, management board chairman Karlheinz Kaske said.    Siemens reported world group turnover in 198586 of 47.02billion marks.    Kaske told the annual shareholders meeting turnover rose to21.2 billion marks in the first five months of 198687, about19 pct above the same yearago period. The rise was mainly dueto payment in January for a West German nuclear power stationwhich led to a jump in domestic sales of 36 pct.    In the first five 198687 months, turnover abroad showed athree pct increase, Kaske said, without giving figures.    In the same period incoming orders rose five pct to 21.8billion marks against the same 198586 period.    For the year as a whole incoming orders should rise betweenone and two billion marks to around 51 or 52 billion.    Apart from payments for the nuclear power station, thecommunications and telecommunications sectors in particularshould contribute to growth this year, Kaske said.    But it was not possible to make a profit forecast for198687 because of uncertainty about the direction of thedollar, Kaske said.    Siemens already reported that first quarter 198687 groupnet profit fell marginally to 296 mln marks from 298 mln in thesame period in the previous year.    Turnover in the first five months rose particularlystrongly in the installations and automotive technology,communications and telecommunications sectors, but componentsand energy and automation showed a sharp decline.    Kaske said domestic orders rose to 10.2 billion marks inthe first five months of this year, or nine pct above theirlevel in the same 198586 period, boosted in particular byorders for the fully owned Kraftwerk Union AG subsidiary.    Foreign orders grew one pct to 11.6 billion marks. Anincrease in orders through newly acquired subsidiaries abroadwas balanced by the decline in the dollar.    While the installations and automotive technology sectorshowed a sharp rise in orders, energy and automation andcommunications orders were below the level achieved in the sameperiod of 198586.    Telecommunications orders remained at roughly the samelevel.    Kaske said investments were expected to remain around sixbillion marks in 198687 after a 50 pct increase the previousyear. Research and development were likely to rise 13 pct to6.1 billion marks or around 12 pct of turnover. REUTER3"

Third party turnover declined to 15.9 billion from 18.5billion in 1985 while orders slipped to 15.5 billion marks from16.9 billion, it said in a preliminary statement.    Despite these figures, which reflected the dollarsweakness against the mark and oil and raw materials pricefalls, it said 1986 was a satisfactory year.    The reason was the continued expansion of the machinery andplant sector, which accounted for 42 pct of total sales.    Krupp added that some areas of the mechanical engineeringbusiness achieved notable growth rates and acquisitions hadunderpinned machinery and component activities.    An orders decline in the steel and, in particular, thetrading and services sectors, affected the groups total orderfigures.    However, all business sectors contributed to the positiveresults achieved in 1986, Krupp added, without giving details.    Domestic orders decreased by five pct to 9.6 billion marksfrom the previous year and foreign orders fell 14 pct to 5.9billion, it said. Foreign business accounted for 38 pct oforders against 40 pct in 1985.

Orders received by the steel sector last year decreased bythree pct to 6.2 billion marks from 1985, it said.

The ministrys parliamentary state secretary Ludolf Georgvon Wartenberg, told a business conference German exports couldstart rising again in real terms during 1987, reversing thelower export trend which emerged in mid1986.    But even if the turnaround did not occur, there would be noneed to worry about the economy as long as the weakness ofexports did not affect currently good domestic demand.    Von Wartenberg said consumer demand remained quite good butnoted there had been a cooling in the investment climate. Thisis certainly a reason for heightened watchfulness but not forstimulative steps, he said.    The best way for Bonn to help its exporters is to workactively to promote free world trade, he added.    Von Wartenberg said the economy still had good exportopportunities. Price alone was not the only factor ininternational competitiveness, he said, adding German firmshave a reputation for high quality standards, prompt deliverytimes and good service.    Von Wartenberg said the government was in a difficultposition on its trade figures.  It faced international pressureto reduce its trade surplus, but West Germans were worriedabout the effect of the marks strength on the countrysexporters.    Reports about the trade surplus, especially overseas,tended to concentrate on nominal trade figures, which rose to arecord 112.2 billion marks in 1986, he said. But this rise wasdue entirely to the lower value of imports caused by thedecline of both the dollar and oil prices. German exports havein fact been falling in real terms for sometime, he said.

  "title": "MONETARY AUTHORITIES SAID TO LOSE CREDIBILITY",
  "body": "The monetary authorities of the majorindustrialised countries lost their credibility this week asthe dollar was sold off despite pleas from ministers andwidespread central bank intervention, dealers said.    The dollars fall below 150 yen, which follows last monthsParis currency stabilisation agreement by the U.S., Japan, WestGermany, Britain, France and Canada, is a dramatic reversal ofthe success of the Group of Five G5 1985 New York Plazameeting to weaken the dollar, they said.    The G5 and the market agreed in 1985 that the dollar wasovervalued but this time the market and the authorities are ondifferent sides, dealers said.    Apparent confusion in the ranks of the G5 nations hasencouraged the market to challenge the authorities despiteconcerted intervention by the central banks of the UnitedStates, Japan, Britain and West Germany, they said.    Pleas by Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa foraction to stabilise the dollar were matched over the weekend bycomments by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker that there wasno target zone for the dollar. The dollar was sold anyway.    Yesterdays comment by Baker that he stood by the Parisaccord did nothing to reverse sentiment, dealers said.    The intervention, backed by remarks by Fed Chairman PaulVolcker and Japanese central bank governor Satoshi Sumita,which a few months ago would have brought the dollar fall to ahalt, has done little but slow the rate of its decline, theynoted.    The situation has again raised the question of whetherintervention can succeed against the trend in todays hugecurrency markets. Dealers said the markets cool response tointervention reflected a basic oversupply of dollars.    This means that the current dollar selling is not of asheer speculative nature but backed by real demand, said KoichiMiyazaki, deputy general manager at Sanwa Bank.    Dealers said the dollar will remain weak despite theintervention and it is only a matter of time before someoperators try to push it below 148 yen. The dollar closed inTokyo today at 149.40 against New Yorks 149.3040. Its recordlow was 148.40 in Tokyo last Tuesday.    Dealers said the dollar will gain only temporary support torise above 150 yen toward early April when the Group of Sevenindustrial nations meets to discuss currencies again.    The market expects the seven nations the Paris six plusItaly to try to agree on another way to stabilise currenciesapart from intervention, a chief dealer at a U.S. Bank said.    Dealers said they were unsure what other methods could beused and they are sceptical anyway about how long the Parisaccord nations, particulary the U.S., Will remain willing toprevent a further dollar fall given the continuing high U.S.Trade deficit, especially with Japan.    Further pressure from a protectionist U.S. Congress for alower dollar is also limiting Washingtons options, they said.    The market now thinks the central bank action is to slowthe dollar fall, not to push it back over 150 yen, saidTadahiko Nashimoto, manager at Long Term Credit Bank of Japan.    Another bearish factor for the dollar is expected largeforward dollar sales from April to June for export billsfalling due for Japanese exporters from April to September.    The exporters had delayed in expectation of a further yendepreciation, dealers said.    Yesterdays request to 30 trading houses by the Ministry ofInternational Trade and Industry to restrict dollar sales looksineffective in light of this real demand, they said.    The market is also anticipating active institutional dollarsales to hedge currency risks on bond holdings from the newbusiness year starting April 1, dealers said.    The market seems to have established a new dollar tradingrange between 147 and 149 yen, one dealer said.    The dollar traded between 151 and 153 yen after the Parisaccord on February 22 and 150 yen was then considered the lowend for the dollar against the yen, he said.    Some dealers now believe that if the dollar falls below 148yen, it will pick up renewed downward momentum and slide to145. REUTER3"

  "title": "ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT  SWISS BANKING SECRECY",
  "body": "Swiss lawyers have largely headed off anattempt to restrict banking secrecy and curb their powers toact for clients despite the new, revised code of bankingconduct agreed by the Bankers Association this week, analystssaid.    The laundering of drug and insider dealing money andcontroversy over accounts of the ousted Philippine and HaitianPresidents have hurt the standing of Swiss banks recently andstrained international relations, particularly with the UnitedStates.    Critics said the new code fell well short of demands forreform, doing little to close a key loophole in the requirementthat banks know the identity of their customers.    The Social Democratic party, a member of the rulingfourparty coalition, which forced an unsuccesful 1984referendum to curb banking secrecy, complained the code stillfell short of the legal controls they wanted.    It looks a slight improvement on paper, but the same trickswill still be possible in practice, Felix Meier, a senior partyofficial, told Reuters.    In contrast, Swiss lawyers are happy with the new code.    Apart from a few nuances, we are very pleased with theagreement, said Max Oesch, a senior official of the SwissLawyers Federation, which has fought a long campaign to preventany curbs on lawyers ability to act for their clients.    It has shown that the 4,000 Swiss lawyers who do a good jobshould not be punished for the sake of getting at the one ortwo black sheep.    The role of lawyers has been at the centre of long runningdiscussions on the renewal of the socalled convention ofdiligence, a voluntary code of banking conduct introduced inresponse to a major banking scandal here in 1977.    With secrecy back in the public eye due to the FerdinandMarcos case and a Swiss bank link to the recently busted PizzaConnection international heroin ring, officials at the BankingCommission said earlier this year they wanted a tightening ofrules on anonymity.    However, the changes in the new code, which comes intooperation in October, have been minor.    Clients will still be able to keep their identity secretfrom the banks provided their lawyer pledges that therelationship with his client is not only of a temporary natureand involves provision of other legal services.    The Lawyers Association said this part of their businessis very minimal anyway. In the majority of cases, people hadperfectly legal private or commercial reasons for not wantingthe bank to know their identity, Oesch said.    The Banking Commission, despite its earlier demand for avirtual abolition of the loophole, also said it was happy withthe new code.    However, critics complain that the agreement does not gofar enough to restrict the role of lawyers and could still becircumvented by criminals.    No other group in society is allowed to regulate itself asmuch as the banks, complained Meier of the Social Democrats. Ihope that the Banking Commission exercises its proper controlfunction.    However, other parts of the agreement won praise.    In particular, banks will also now be required to demandthe identity anyone doing more than 100,000 Swiss francs worthof business with them, even if they do not have an account atthe bank. Until now, the threshold was 500,000 francs.    Peter Kluser, head of the National Banks legal department,which had argued for a lower limit, said the move could helpcombat the use of banks to launder or hide the criminal originof money.    The new code also clarifies the legal status of a tribunalable to impose heavy fines on banks which do not respect thecode. REUTER3"

  "body": "The International Wheat Council IWClifted its estimate for 198687 world wheat and coarse grainproduction by one mln tonnes to a record 1,377 mln, comparedwith 1,351 mln tonnes the previous season.    In its monthly market report, the IWC said it is leavingunchanged its forecast of world wheat production for the coming198788 season at between 520 and 530 mln tonnes against arecord 534 mln in 198687. The one mln tonne upward revision in198687 wheat production reflects several minor adjustments.The IWC raised the 198687 coarse grain trade figure two mln to87 mln tonnes. It left wheat trade unchanged at 86 mln.    The IWC 198687 estimate for world trade in wheat andcoarse grain is thus estimated two mln tonnes higher at 173 mlnagainst 169 mln the previous season with the forecast three mlnrise in Soviet imports offset by small reductions elsewhere.    The IWC said the area harvested for wheat in 198788 islikely to be down from last year as low world prices andrestrictive national policies measures begin to take effect.    At least four of the five major exporters expect to see adrop in wheat sowings without offset in other countries. Thereis still potential for even higher average wheat yields but theIWC said there are increasing signs world output may level off.    Although it is still early to assess the coarse grainoutlook, the IWC said barley acreage is likely to fall in theEuropean Community but increase in Canada. U.S. Maize area isexpected lower but oat sowings could rise.    After damage to its maize crop last year, the Soviet Unionplans to expand this area by as much as 50 pct to over six mlnhectares in a year when many frost damaged wheat fields arelikely to be resown to this and other spring crops. Improvedweather and a further increase in the use of intensivecultivation methods could therefore see a marked rise in Sovietmaize output in 1987, the IWC said.    Any reduction in world coarse grain output would bebolstered by the large carryover stocks from 198687, the IWCsaid.    It left its estimates of wheat and coarse grain stocks atend127of different marketing years unchanged at 178 and 210 mlntonnes, respectively, against 160 and 167 mln a year earlier.    After record world durum wheat production of 218.8 mlntonnes last season, the IWC said there are already signs ofanother large crop this coming season with higher outputexpected in the EC, Canada, the U.S. And North Africa.

  "body": "The release of U.K. February trade datashowing that the current account surplus was a provisional 376mln stg, up from a 73 mln surplus in January, has boosted hopesof an early cut in interest rates, analysts said.    Market forecasts had been for a worse outcome, withexpectations of a deficit in visible trade averaging about 750mln stg, against the official figure of 224 mln stg, sharplynarrower than Januarys 527 mln deficit.    The figures are unreservedly good, Chase ManhattanSecurities economist Andrew Wroblewski said.    Sterling rebounded on the trade figures, reversing a weakermorning trend, to stand at 72.1 pct of its trade weighted indexagainst a basket of currencies at midday, unchanged fromyesterdays close but 0.3 points above the 1100 GMT level.    The market had feared that a deteriorating nonoil tradepattern would undermine international support for sterling,which has been the motor behind the recent fall in U.K.Interest rates. Money market sources said the market had begunto doubt that a widely expected drop in bank base lending ratesto 9.5 pct from the present 10.0 pct was really on the cards.    But sentiment now looks to have turned about again.    There now looks to be no danger that the Chancellor of theExchequer Nigel Lawsons forecast of a 1987 current accountdeficit of 2.5 billion stg will be exceeded, Wroblewski said.    Seasonally adjusted figures showed imports rose in Februaryto 7.16 billion stg from 6.73 billion in January.    Exports rose to a record 6.93 billion from 6.20 billion.    However, Chris Tinker, U.K. Analyst at brokers Phillips andDrew said the faster rise in exports than imports would provepartly aberrational in coming months. He forecast theChancellors Budget tax cuts would increase consumerexpenditure on imported goods.    However, Warburg Securities economist Ian Harwood said hisfirm was sharply revising its 1987 current account deficitforecast in the light of the latest data, cutting one billionstg off the expected full year total to about 1.75 billion stg.    He said news of strong growth in exports of nonoil goodsconfirmed recent bullish surveys among members of theConfederation of British Industry.    The growth in imports appears to be flattening, even ifJanuarys bad weather had curbed consumer spending on overseasgoods and importintensive stock building among manufacturers,Harwood said.    U.K. Government bonds, or gilts, surged by more than 12point on the betterthanexpected news, as earlier worriesabout the figures evaporated.    Sterling peaked at a high of 1.6075 dlrs, before settlingto a steady 1.6050 about 1300 GMT, nearly a cent higher thanthe European low of 1.5960.    However, analysts noted that the turnabout in marketsentiment still looks highly vulnerable to political news.    Morning weakness in sterling and the gilt market waslargely attributed to a newspaper opinion poll showing that theConservative governments support was slipping.    LONDON, March 26  The Bank of England said it provided 15mln stg in assistance to the money market this morning, buyingbank bills in band two at 91316 pct.    Earlier the Bank revised its money market liquidityforecast from a flat position to a deficit of around 350 mlnstg. REUTER3"

I am very concerned about the Brazilian economy, he toldreporters after a news conference in Tokyo.    He said Brazil had caught the attention of the world withits decision last month to stop paying interest on its loansfrom commercial banks but warned it not to sqaunder the time itgained by failing to come up with a new economic program.    Brazils decision jolted the worlds financial community asthe country is 108 billion dlrs in debt, including some 68billion owed to commercial banks.    Brazilian Finance Ministry sources said in Brasiliayesterday that the country was preparing a new economicstrategy designed to ensure domestic economic growth.    Despite mounting domestic and overseas pressure, Brazil hassaid repeatedly that it will not go to the InternationalMonetary Fund IMF for help in drawing up a new plan for fearthat will only throw its economy into recession.    Conable said the country may be able to get away with notgoing to the IMF for help, but will need an IMFtype economicprogram if it wants to regain the confidence of lenders.    Outsiders like the World Bank are reluctant to suggestpossible solutions to Brazils economic problems because of thedelicate political situation there, he added.    While the World Bank has a role to play in helping Brazil,it can127ot replace the IMF as an overseer of the economy,Conable said. He added that the Fund can be very flexible inits dealings with developing countries, adjusting its approachto the political realities.    Brazil still seems willing to talk to the Fund under theannual discussions that all IMF members undertake, Conablesaid, adding that this could partially solve the currentstalemate.    During his news conference, Conable said the World Bankbacked U.S. Treasury Secretary James Bakers Third World debtinitiative, which calls for stepped up lending to heavilyindebted Third World countries adopting economic policies.    The World Bank believes the Baker initiative is the bestapproach, he said. Debt forgiveness is difficult to design inany fair way and also will tend to discourage furtherinvestment and development.    He cited the recent multibillion dollar debt package forMexico, the Third Worlds most indebted country after Brazil.    Will it work he asked. We dont know...But we think itmore likely to work than any of the alternatives suggested.    Conable, who is here to meet government and businessleaders, expressed confidence that Japan will make increasinguse of its huge trade surplus to help developing countries.    We are quite confident Japan will make an increasinginvestment in development because of their willingness tosupport institutions like ours in increasing ways with eachpassing year, he said. REUTER3"

  "title": "IWC SAYS EFFECT OF LOWER SUPPORT PRICES LIMITED",
  "body": "Efforts by governments to control wheatsurpluses by cutting support prices have met with only partialsuccess, the International Wheat Council IWC says in itslatest monthly report.    Faster results could be achieved by a policy of reducingboth price and areas, as employed in the United States, the IWCsays in a survey of support prices in the five main wheatexporters  Argentina, Australia, Canada, the EC and the U.S.    In some countries, for example Australia and Argentina,which are highly dependent on wheat shipments for exportincome, there may be problems in reducing production.    A policy of cutting wheat production could lead tounemployment, with job prospects outside agriculture limited.Alternative crops may offer inferior returns which could thenlead to lost export revenue and balance of payments problems.    The IWC outlines three courses of action open togovernments in wheat exporting countries.    They could continue to support prices in the hope that whenthe world economy improves demand for wheat will rise andsurpluses wil be reduced or eliminated.    Alternatively, support could be limited to wheat whichcould be easily sold, without needing to be stored for a longperiod.    This option may prove to be the most politicallyunattractive and would result in many producers abandoningwheat production, the report said.    The third option would be for governments to distinguishbetween the commercial and social aspects of agriculture,possibly varying support prices according to farm size oroverall production.    The IWC review covers support prices in the major exportingcountries since 1982. At some time during that period all theproducers cut support prices in response to growing surpluses.    These changes did not always result in lower exportsubsidies as on several occasions currency fluctuations morethan offset lower prices in the domestic currency.    For example between 198586 and 198687 the EC interventionprice for bread wheat fell from 209.30 to 179.44 Europeancurrency units Ecus. It dollar terms, the currency in whichmost export transactions are denominated, the interventionprice however rose to 193 dlrs from 168. The high cost ofsupporting farm prices has put a strain on national exchequersand some governments are now searching for ways to cutexpenditure, the report says.    The proportion of world wheat output produced by the fivemajor exporters declined in the period covered by the surveyfrom 40 pct in 1982 to 35 pct in 1987. This was partly due toincreased production in China and India.    The period saw an upward trend in yields, although this wascountered in the Argentina, the U.S. And Australia by loweracreages.    In Argentina a reduction in the sown area of about 20 percent was put down to low prices causing producers to switch toother enterprises, particularly livestock while lower U.S.Acreages are attributed to official incentives.

He said U.S. taxpayers are taxed at a rate of 19 pct of GNPwhich is traditionally where it has been, but the FederalGovernment is spending at a rate of 24 pct of GNP. Baker saidspending cuts are clearly the best way to cut budget deficits.    Baker said he opposed a stock transactions tax proposed byHouse Speaker Jim Wright, DTex, or other special taxes.    The stock transfer tax would be a particularly unfortunateapproach to take, the Treasury Secretary said. He said theUnited States has some of the most efficient capital markets inthe world and new taxes would impair efficiency.    On the international front, Baker said banks must do morelending to developing countries. He was questioned about thisafter the Standard and Poors Corp downgrading today of thedebt of six major money center bank holding companies, largelybecause of their heavy developing nation loan exposure.    Baker said that developing countries must adopt free marketeconomic policies such as in the United States. He said capitalflows will be required to support the needed reforms in theeconomic systems of those countries.    The money must come either through equity or debt and Bakersaid that developing nations investment regimes do notsupport enough equity investment, so youve got to have somedebt there.    Commenting on the U.S. trade deficit, Baker said I thinkyoure going to see a 15 to 20 billion dlr reduction thisyear."

  "title": "PHILIPPINE DEBT TALKS PROCEED WITH NARROWER FOCUS",
  "body": "The latest round of talks betweenPhilippine officials and the countrys commercial bankcreditors on the rescheduling of 9.4 billion dlrs worth of debtare still proceeding, but with a narrower focus, PhilippineFinance Secretary Jaime Ongpin said.    He told a press briefing Wednesday that Manila has droppeda twotier interest payment offer, which would have given banksa higher return if they took partial payment in new Philippineinvestment notes PINs instead of in cash.    The PINs proposal has been laid aside.... The discussion isnow on pricing of just the cash payments, he said.    Foreign banking sources in Manila said on Tuesday that thePhilippines had raised its basic interest rate offer to 78over the London interbank offered rate LIBOR but Ongpin wouldnot discuss details of the pricing negotiations.    He also refused to speculate on when an overall agreementmight be reached. The talks have been going on for more thanthree weeks.    Manila originally offered to pay interest in cash at 58over LIBOR or in a mixture of cash and PINs  tradeable,dollardenominated, zero coupon notes that could potentiallyyield up to one point over LIBOR.    The PINs option was subsequently modified to guarantee atleast a 78 point spread over LIBOR but many bankers still hadgrave reservations, seeing it as a possible precedent for otherlarge debtors to avoid paying interest in cash.    The PINs proposal has now been left on the table as aseparate option for those banks, which might want to fund theirown investments in the Philippines or sell the notes in thesecondary market, Ongpin said.    Under Manilas plan, the PINs would be redeemable at fullface value in Philippine pesos to fund local equity investmentsat any time prior to their sixyear maturity date.    While the commercial banks had their doubts about the PINsproposal, Ongpin said there was great interest on the part ofcertain investment banks which are already active in thesecondary market for sovereign debt.    Unlike current debtequity schemes, Ongpin said, the PINswould include no government fees and would be free fromadministrative hassles.    He said about six investment banks had been approached andfour had replied so far. One even showed interest in buying 45mln dlrs worth of notes, he said.    Ongpin said that by funding current interest payments inthe secondary market through the PINs scheme, the Philippinescould conserve at least one to 1.5 billion dlrs of foreignexchange reserves during its planned sevenyear restructuringperiod.

  "body": "The price of gold bullion is likelyto rise in the second half of the year on increased privateinvestor demand, West German analysts said.    Gold could rise as high as 500 dlrs per ounce later thisyear, said Peter Witte, director of Westdeutsche LandesbankGirozentrales trading division, after a presentation by theU.S. Mint to promote its gold and silver Eagle series coins.    A lot will depend on oil prices and developments on stockexchanges, Witte said, adding he saw gold positioned forfurther rises once it breaks out above 450 dlrs.    Gold was fixed this morning in London at 411.30 dlrs.    Despite current strong interest in gold mine stocks, manyinvestors still want to buy physical gold, Witte said.    Interest in gold mine stocks may also wane if stockexchange rallies under way in many countries start to waver.    Hermann Strohmeyer, vice president of Commerzbank AGsforeign exchange trading and treasury department, said gold ispoised to rise to 460 to 470 dlrs an ounce in the second halfof this year.    The price is unlikely to fall much below 380 or 390 dlrs anounce, and probably will continue in a range between 380 and430 dlrs in the first half of this year, he said. REUTER3"

Under the proposed rules, a banks minimum capitalrequirement would be determined by the assessed risk of theirassets, including off balance sheet liabilities that are notcurrently taken into account.    Currently, banks must retain a primary capital ratio of 5.5pct.    First Interstate reported a primary capital ratio of 6.14pct at the end of 1986.    Pinola said First Interstate has since raised that ratio,however, to about 6.70 pct, through a recent preferred stockoffering and a 200mlndlr subordinated capital note offeringannounced yesterday.    First Interstate reported a relatively average return onassets ratio of 0.68 at the end of 1986.    Pinola said First Interstates return on assets ratio willimprove to the 0.700.71 range at the end of the first quarter,because 1986 yearend assets, at 55.4 billion dlrs, wereoverestimated by about two billion dlrs.

  "title": "BRITISH BANKS RESIST SIGNING MEXICO PACKAGE",
  "body": "British banks are resisting signing a 76billion dlr rescheduling package for Mexico in a last ditcheffort to get all participants to contribute equally to a new7.7 billion dlr loan contained in the package.    Christopher Brougham, regional manager, rescheduling unit,at Lloyds Bank Plc, said in response to a Reuter enquiry, thatthe six major U.K. Clearing banks last week sent a telex toCitibank saying they would contribute what was requestedprovided all other major lenders did the same and that the U.S.Banks contribute at least 90 pct of the amount required bythem.    Other bankers, who declined to be identified, said othergroups of banks particularly those in Switzerland, France andCanada, were equally reluctant to sign, although they had notsent any telex to Citibank, which chairs Mexicos 13bankadvisory group.    However, they said it was likely that if and when theBritish banks sign the accord, the others are likely to follow.    Under the agreement, for which the signing began on Friday,commercial banks are being asked to contribute 12.9 pct oftheir exposure to Mexico as of August 1982. That was the dateof the first Mexican debt crisis.    After months of haggling, a proposed rescheduling agreementfor Mexico was struck last September during the annual meetingof the World Bank and International Monetary Fund inWashington.    Ever since then the advisory group, of which Lloyds is amember, has been attempting to round up the needed signatories.    However, there has been considerable resistance to thepackage, partly because of some of the clauses it contains andpartly because many small U.S. Regional banks do not want toincrease their exposure to any Latin American countries.    Brougham said, We British banks have always played alongfor Mexico and will do so as long as others share equally.    The decision to send the telexes was agreed on by the sixclearers jointly, but each sent its own telex.    In addition to Lloyds, telexes were sent by NationalWestminster Bank Plc, Barclays Bank Plc, Midland Bank Plc,127tandard Chartered Bank Plc and Royal Bank of Scotland Plc.    Brougham noted that so far the U.S. Banks have only reached8312 pct of the total that is expected from them, while thelevel of contributions from the U.K. Banks is well in excess of90 pct. The U.S. Figure should be closer to ours, he said.    Many bankers have been angered by the resistance of theregional U.S. Banks, noting that even if they dont contributeto the new loan they still will be receiving interest on theexisting loans.    The banks still have three weeks to sign the agreement andbankers are hoping all will go according to plan.    In the meantime, bankers expect further pressure will beexercised on the regional banks and the major U.S. Banks tofind a solution to the problem. Many have suggested that thelarger U.S. Banks should take on the additional obligations,but so far they have resisted this.    Bankers expect that much of the pressure on the U.S. Bankswill come from U.S. Regulators, notably the Federal Reserve.    Bankers prefer to view the stance taken by the Britishbanks and other national groups as a matter of principal, andburden sharing rather than as a pressure tactic to force theU.S. Banks to make up their share.    The bankers are not the only ones to be upset by theprotracted negotiations surrounding the agreement.    The Mexicans themselves have been angered by the delays. Atthe signing in New York last Friday, Finance Minister GustavoPetricioli sounded a warning to the recalcitrant banks.    Those who supported us today can be sure that Mexico willcontinue to be open and willing to share with them the businessopportunities which its future growth will create, Petriciolisaid.    Conversion of bank debt into equity investments in Mexicois one option banks can take advantage of to reduce theirexposure. But Mexico halted its debt for equity program inFebruary in an effort to concentrate on finalising the package.    On Friday, Petricioli said We will be a lot moreexpeditious in processing the requests of banks that havesupported us.    The pressure on the U.S. Banks comes at a time when othermajor Latin American debtors are in the process of crucial debtnegotiations.    Brazil, the third worlds largest debtor, has suspended allinterest payments on its 109 billion dlrs of foreign debt. Manyof the major U.S. Banks, including Citibank, have already saidthey might have to put their Brazil loans on a cash basis andtake the financial losses, which could total billions ofdollars.    This would be required by U.S. Banking regulations if theinterest payments are more than 90 days overdue.    However, the U.S. Banks are not the only ones threatened byregulations. In the U.K., A proposed Inland Revenue rulingwould affect the tax treatment of certain types of loans, manyof which are made to Latin American countries.    Basically, the ruling wants to limit the tax credit a bankcan claim for tax withheld by foreign governments on loaninterest payments.    The British banks are planning to fight the proposals astheir implementation could prove extremely costly, not just interms of compliance but in limiting future business. REUTER3"

  "body": "The release of U.K. February trade datashowing that the current account surplus was a provisional 376mln stg, up from a 73 mln surplus in January, has boosted hopesof an early cut in interest rates, analysts said.    Market forecasts had been for a worse outcome, withexpectations of a deficit in visible trade averaging about 750mln stg, against the official figure of 224 mln stg, sharplynarrower than Januarys 527 mln deficit.    The figures are unreservedly good, Chase ManhattanSecurities economist Andrew Wroblewski said.    Sterling rebounded on the trade figures, reversing a weakermorning trend, to stand at 72.1 pct of its trade weighted indexagainst a basket of currencies at midday, unchanged fromyesterdays close but 0.3 points above the 1100 GMT level.    The market had feared that a deteriorating nonoil tradepattern would undermine international support for sterling,which has been the motor behind the recent fall in U.K.Interest rates. Money market sources said the market had begunto doubt that a widely expected drop in bank base lending ratesto 9.5 pct from the present 10.0 pct was really on the cards.    But sentiment now looks to have turned about again.    There now looks to be no danger that the Chancellor of theExchequer Nigel Lawsons forecast of a 1987 current accountdeficit of 2.5 billion stg will be exceeded, said Wroblewski.    Seasonally adjusted figures showed that imports rose inFebruary to 7.16 billion stg from 6.73 billion in January.    Exports rose to a record 6.93 billion from 6.20 billion.    However, Chris Tinker, U.K. Analyst at brokers Phillips andDrew said that the faster rise in exports than imports wouldprove partly aberrational in coming months. He forecast theChancellors Budget tax cuts would increase consumer expeditureon imported goods.    However, Ian Harwood, economist at Warburg Securities, saidhis firm was sharply revising its 1987 current account deficitforecast in the light of the latest data, cutting one billionstg off the expected full year total to about 1.75 billion stg.    He said news of strong growth in exports of nonoil goodsconfirmed recent bullish surveys among members of theConfederation of British Industry.    The growth in imports appears to be flattening, even ifJanuarys bad weather had curbed consumer spending on overseasgoods and importintensive stock building among manufactureres,Harwood said.    U.K. Government bonds, or gilts, surged by more than 12point on the betterthanexpected news, as earlier worriesabout the figures evaporated.    Sterling peaked at a high of 1.6075 dlrs, before settlingto a steady 1.6050 dlrs about 1300 GMT, nearly a cent higherthan the European low of 1.5960.    However, analysts noted that the turnabout in marketsentiment still looks highly vulnerable to political news.    Morning weakness in sterling and the gilt market waslargely attributed to a newspaper opinion poll showing that theConservative governments support was slipping.    The Marplan poll, published in Today, showed Conservativesupport had fallen to 36 pct, from 38 pct last month, while theAlliance of Liberals and Social Democrats had rallied to 31pct, from 21 pct, to run neck and neck with the Labour Party,whose own support fell from 38 pct.    The poll was taken after the Budget, which was greetedenthusiastically by financial markets but seems to have leftthe voters indifferent, political observers said.    Another regular poll is due tomorrow, and eonomists warnthat todays improved sentiment could be dented if support forPrime Minister Margaret Thatcher slips again.    This upsetting of the markets political perceptions, whichare all but discounting a Conservative victory in the upcominggeneral election, made them more sensitive to the trade data,Harwood said. The news did come as a very, very substantialrelief, he said.    However, on the interest rate front, economists cautionthat Lawson might be wary of leaving sterling vulnerable byencouraging another base rate fall. They noted Lawson hadalready got an inflationreducing cut in mortgage rates inresponse to lower base rates, so domestic political reasons forlower rates have been curtailed. REUTER3"

Gold was fixed this morning in London at 411.30 dlrs.    Despite current strong interest in gold mine stocks, manyinvestors still want to buy physical gold, Witte said.    Interest in gold mine stocks may also wane if stockexchange rallies under way in many countries start to waver.    Hermann Strohmeyer, vice president of Commerzbank AGsforeign exchange trading and treasury department, said gold ispoised to rise to 460 to 470 dlrs an ounce in the second halfof this year.

In testimony prepared for delivery before a Senate bankingsubcommittee, Mulford said there was broad recognition in Paristhat further substantial exchange rate shifts could damagegrowth and adjustment prospects.    But he also said while there are clear understandings amongthe countries regarding cooperation, We have refrained fromestablishing a system of target zones or ranges.    Mulford also said the six nations have not spelled out theway in which they intend to deal with possible marketdevelopments.    He said governments must retain flexibility in dealing withexchange market pressures and efforts to establish rigidexchange rate objectives or to specify too precisely the goalsof intervention would hurt official attempts to react tomarket pressures, he said.    Accordingly, Mulford said setting specific currencyobjectives and intervention to achieve those objectives wouldbe counterproductive.    Commenting on the trade deficit, Mulford reiterated theTreasury position that the current account deficit will declinefrom 148 billion dlrs last year to around 130 billion dlrs thisyear, due to the exchange rate adjustments of the past 18months.    But he added trade imbalances would also be corrected bycommitments from West Germany and Japan to stimulate theireconomies and by U.S. efforts to cut the budget deficit andenhance U.S. competitiveness.

World sales, which began on October 20, 1986, reached 2.193mln ounces in less than six months of sales. This made it worldmarket leader with a share of 37 pct in 1986, Pope said.    Pope said that in volume terms, nearly half of all goldEagle sales were within North America, roughly 40 pct were inEurope and about eight pct in Asia.    She said despite introduction of several new gold bullioncoins on the market recently, the Mint is aiming to preservethe Eagles strong market share with extensive publicity.    The Mint uses mainly newly mined U.S. Gold for the coins,as long as this is available at market prices. The remaininggold is taken either from U.S. Treasury stocks, or from theopen market, Pope said.    Gold analysts said the Eagle is facing competition herefrom the Canadian Maple Leaf, and also to a lesser extent fromthe South African Krugerrand. Some estimated the Maple LeafsWest German market share at 60 pct.    The figures may be distorted, as many German investors buygold bullion in Switzerland or Luxembourg to escape the 14 pctvalueadded tax imposed here. Including the tax, the oneouncecoins traded today at 906 marks, they said.    Competition may also come from new gold coins, includingBelgiums ECU, which began sales today. Britain and Australiaalso have plans to mint gold bullion coins, the analysts said. REUTER3"

  "body": "U.S. Treasury Assistant SecretaryDavid Mulford said he foresaw substantial net new commercialloans to the major debtor countries in 1987.    In testimony before a Senate banking subcommittee, Mulfordsaid he based this prediction on progress in talks betweenbanks and Mexico, Chile, and Venezuela, as well as progress innegotiations with the Philippines.    These agreements, together with others for Argentina andwe hope Brazil, should assure substantial new loans this year,Mulford said.    Mulford defended the U.S. strategy for handling the debtcrisis and added additional steps, like development bycommercial banks of a menu of options to support debtor reform,can be undertaken.    That particular development would maintain broad bankparticipation in new financing packages to debtors.    Mulford stessed that greater flexibility in devising newmoney packages may be essential for future bank syndications.    The commercial banks have much to gain from taking thelead themselves to develop the kinds of ideas that help assurethe concerted lending process works, he said.    In particular, Mulford said banks and debtor nations willincreasingly move toward repricing, retiming or reschedulingagreements as an alternative to new loans.    The benefits of such approaches may be substantial andmay, in the right circumstances, be easier to achieve than newmoney packages, he said.    But for debtors with substantial financing needs, newlending will still be necessary, he said.    Mulford rejected congressional ideas for a debt facility asbeing far too costly to creditor governments, and ultimatelytaxpayers.    Mulford urged further development of debtequity swaps aswell as broader mutual funds for conversion into equity.    As in the past, Mulford said progress must be founded oneconomic reforms and sufficient new financing for debtors bothto support those reforms and generate new growth."

  "body": "Aluminium scrap recovery and usage andoutput of secondary metal will continue to rise, said ShearsonLehman Brothers in a review of the secondary aluminium marketwhich details cost and demand factors.    Although primary smelting costs have declined generally inrecent years, the still substantial energy cost savings offeredby secondary smelters will continue to make remelted materialincreasingly attractive.    It takes around 15,000 kilowatt hours kwh of electricityto produce one tonne of primary aluminium compared with around550 kwh for one tonne of secondary metal, Shearson said.    On the demand side, developments in automobiles andpackaging bode well for secondary aluminium consumption.    Automobile production, although expected to fall this year,is still on an upward trend and will continue to be so for theforeseeable future and, in addition, use of aluminium castingsis gaining wider acceptance in the automobile industry,particularly in the U.S.    In packaging, Shearson does not expect aluminium todominate the beverage can market in any of the other majoreconomies to the extent it does in the U.S., But says there isevidence recycling is on the increase in other countries.    In addition to the cost savings involved, technologyadvances now enable alloys of higher purity to be produced bythe secondary aluminium industry, Shearson said.    There is not likely to be a problem of availability as theU.S. Has a huge scrap reservoir and this is also true ofseveral European countries, albeit on a smaller scale."

  "body": "The French government will present toparliament a major bill within two months to overhaul the Parisstock market, economics and finance minister Edouard Balladursaid.    Balladur told an Economist conference that on the productside, a series of new contracts, including share options andforward contracts in European Currency Units ECUs, would beintroduced shortly for trading on the Paris bourse.    The scope of the new bill, however, was to transform theorganisation of equity trading, allowing participants both toperform a banking role and to trade in equities, he said.    Currently, the French market is based on the Napoleonicprinciple of separation of equity trading and banking. Thisprinciple has become a dividing, and therefore a weakening,factor for the market, Balladur said.    He said under the planned new rules, stock brokers,currently very specialised and undercapitalised, would be freeto link up with powerful financial institutions after afiveyear transition period.    Stock brokerages would be subject to legislation similar tothat in the U.K. And U.S., He said, adding the Paris marketwould actively attempt to attract foreign securities houses.    Balladur said the French securities market had enjoyedstrong growth in the past 10 years, with new share and bondissues totalling 430 billion French francs in 1986, comparedwith 53 billion in 1976.    New share issues alone totalled 63 billion francs in 1986,up 230 pct from the 1985 level of 19 billion francs, he said.    Total market capitalisation stood at 3,200 billion francsat end1986, compared with 400 billion 10 years earlier, whilestock and bond trades were valued at 2,200 billion francs lastyear against 56 billion in 1976, he said.    Balladur, who also had private talks with U.K. PrimeMinister Margaret Thatcher and Chancellor of the ExchequerNigel Lawson, said his government was also preparing a bill toliberalise the French insurance sector.    Under the proposed rules, an independent regulatoryinsurance commission will be set up. The commission will beendowed with powers similar to those of a body set up earlierto monitor the banking sector, Balladur said.    He said the new bill would also aim to adapt insuranceregulation to take account of the evercloser integration ofall areas of finance. REUTER3"

  "body": "A large Dutch animal feed compounderwill begin formal legal proceedings early next month as a testcase on the way the EC grain coresponsibility levy is applied,a spokesman for Dutch grain and feed trade association, HetComite, told Reuters.    Het Comite has been coordinating national actions againstalleged distortions caused by currency factors in the levy and,since December, has lodged more than 80 individual cases withthe Business Appeal Court in The Hague.    The basic complaint is that the levy does not take accountof currency crossrates of exchange and therefore compoundersin countries with strong currencies may have to pay more intheir own currency than is paid to them by producers in anothercountry.    Het Comite has obtained a temporary agreement thatcompanies can pay the amount they receive toward the levyrather than paying a full guilder amount to the Dutch graincommodity board.    The spokesman said Het Comite will provide financial andlegal backing to the test case in the Business AdministrationCourt in the Hague. Oral proceedings are to begin on April 10.    The spokesman said Het Comite finally selected the companyfor the test case from among the 80 lodged because the billthe firm received from the commodity board for payment of thelevy contained significant currency distortions and involvedgrain from a wide variety of origins. The name of the companyis not being made public.    The Administration Court is not expected to make a finalruling on the case in the near future. The Het Comite spokesmansaid it was very likely it would refer questions to the AppealCourt in Luxembourg, and as a result it could easily be anothernine to 12 months before the matter is finally resolved.    Meanwhile, the actions by Dutch animal feed compounders areputting pressure on the commodity board to urge the Dutchgovernment to follow through on earlier statements and seek acomplete review in Brussels of the way in which the levy iscollected, the spokesman said.    Het Comite, as a member of FEFAC, the association ofEuropean animal feed manufacturers, is also a party to actionsprotesting the whole levy in the Luxembourg appeal court."

  "body": "Treasury Assistant Secretary DavidMulford said the Paris agreement among leading industrialnations is intended to produce reasonable stability in exchangemarkets over the next few months.    He told a Senate Banking subcommittee the Group of Fivenations and Canada agreed in Paris to see if there cant be aperiod of reasonable stability instead of volatility to givetime for the committments in Paris to take place.    Asked by Sen Phil Gramm RTex whether U.S. interventionwas not in fact overvaluing the dollar, Mulford replied thatthe administration judged that after economic adjustments,current exchange rates reflect underlying economicfundamentals.    In particular, the stability sought by the nations wouldallow West Germany and Japan to stimulate their economiesdomestically and the U.S. to cut its budget deficit, Mulfordsaid in his testimony.    He stressed that a further sharp fall in the dollar wouldhurt the ability of Germany and Japan to boost growth.    Mulford noted that half of West Germanys economy wasaffected by international developments.    He also said increased Japanese domestic growth wouldresult in more U.S. exports to Japan and would not necessarilylead to greater Japanese capital flows to the U.S., as Grammasserted, if Japan reformed its domestic capital market.    Commenting on the Paris agreement, Mulford said, I thinkexchange rates ought to be stabilized so Germanys andJapans efforts can be carried out.    Mulford rejected Gramms argument that faster domesticgrowth in Germany and Japan would result in an even lowerdollar.    Mulford said the administration wanted to achieve a patternof higher growth overseas as a way of improving the U.S. tradedeficit.    Otherwise, he said, the trade deficit would be resolvedeither through a much lower dollar or a U.S. recession, bothalternatives he termed unacceptable and undesirable."

But they said recent central bank intervention in theforeign exchange markets appeared to be a limited reaction totemporary pressures rather than a major defence operation.    A Bank of France spokesman declined all comment but sourcesclose to the central bank said it had also intervenedyesterday.    Dealers said the earlier intervention was in concert withthe Bundesbank and Bank of Japan.    The sources said the French central bank could have been inthe market again today in twoway operations, not necessarilyon its own account, but to counter shortterm pressures arisingfrom the end of the Japanese financial year on March 31.    One major French bank said it bought between five and 15mln dlrs for the central bank and sold yen at 149.28 to thedollar.    Another bank said it had been asked by the Bank of Franceto say it was in the market, a departure from the centralbanks usual insistence on confidentiality.    But other banks said they had seen no sign of intervention,which they said appeared to be on a very limited scale.    Even if 10 banks were buying five to 15 mln dlrs, you wouldstill be talking of a small overall amount, said one dealer.    Recent intervention by the Bank of Japan appeared mainly tohave been required to meet yearend window dressing demand foryen. This is a specific short term phenomenon rather than awider trend, the dealer said.    Operators have been extremely cautious about testing thedollars trading ranges against the West German mark andJapanese yen.    These ranges were set in Februarys stabilisation agreementreached here by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker and theFinance Ministers of Japan, Germany, France, Britain andCanada.    But speculative pressures started to build again this weekafter Baker was quoted on British television at the weekend asrepeating earlier statements that Washington had no target forthe dollar.    Baker yesterday moved to defuse speculation he was talkingthe dollar down, telling a Cable News Network interviewer and aSenate committee he stood by the Paris agreement.

Bra Kanon held private bilateral consultations with majorproducers and consumers this morning to resolve outstandingdifferences, mostly on the issues of how much nonmember cocoathe buffer stock can purchase and price differentials fordifferent varieties.    Delegates were fairly confident the differences could beworked out in time to reach agreement tomorrow.    Some consuming member nations, including Britain andBelgium, favour the buffer stock buying more than 10 pctnonmember cocoa, delegates have said.    The consumers argue that buying cheaper, lower qualitynonmember cocoas, particularly Malaysian, will mosteffectively support prices because that low quality cocoa iscurrently pressuring the market.    Producers, meanwhile, say nonmember cocoa should make upat most a very small percentage of the buffer. They sayMalaysia should not be able to benefit from the ICCO unless itis a member, and if the buffer stock bought Malaysian cocoaMalaysia would have no incentive to join, delegates said.    As to differentials, Ghana apparently wanted a higherdifferential for its cocoa than is outlined in the most recentproposal, so it would have a better chance of having its cocoabought for the buffer stock, producer delegates said.    Some consumers wanted differentials to be adjusted in a waythat would not promote buffer stock purchases of the moreexpensive cocoas, such as Ghanaian and Brazilian, they said.    Other technical points need to be sorted out, includinglimits on how much cocoa the buffer stock manager can buy innearby, intermediate and forward positions and the consequenteffect on prices in the various deliveries, delegates said."

Management board member Hans Baur told journalists that theacquisition of a joint 20 pct stake in CGCT by AT and T andPhilips Gloeilampenfabrieken NV PGLO.AS had not been decidedon two years ago as claimed by AT and T.    The French government, which owns CGCT, had asked Siemensat the start of 1986 to submit an offer for the stake in CGCT.The result of the negotiations was still open.    Baur said Siemens had first made an offer last summer.    The Handelsblatt newspaper today quoted AT and T chairmanJames E. Olson as saying that Siemens attempt to stop AT and Tand Philips could lead to a resurgence of protectionism in theU.S.    Baur said he expected the French government to decide onthe winning bid by the end of April. CGCTs share of the Frenchswitchboard market amounts to around 16 pct.    The French government has limited CGCT participation byforeign companies to 20 pct and set a price of 500 mln francsfor the whole company.    Bauer said the 20 pct limitation would only apply to theinitial stake. He did not rule out a stake increase later butsaid Siemens aim was to introduce its technology.

He said that with the move, called a standstillarrangement, Brazil was only trying to avoid difficulties topay its 109 billion dlrs debt in the future.    The spokesman told Reuters that Brazils suggestion will becommunicated by telex to Brazils 700 bank creditors.    The spokesman declined to give details of what was includedin the statement, but said Central Bank president FranciscoGros was seeking a 60day extension of the shortterm creditlines from its commercial bank creditors.    The amount of these credit lines totals 15 billion dollars,and deadline for payment is set for March 31.    Finance Minister Dilson Funaro said in a televisioninterview it was absolutely important for Brazil and itscreditors to renew the shortterm credit lines, as Brazil mustfinance its exports.    If these credit lines were cut, we would face difficultiesto honour our foreign debt in the future, Funaro said.    There is evidently a common interest in the matter, he said.    Funaro said, however, he was told creditors understandBrazils position and do not wish to turn the negotiation forthe renewal of the credit lines more difficult.    Brazil last month suspended interest payments on its 68billion dlrs debt to commercial banks and froze shorttermtrade and money market lines.    He said Brazils suggestion is part of its demands beforethe need to renew the mechanisms of loans in the world.    Funaro said currently debt negotiations are very complexand complicated, mentioning cases of countries which had towait some 10 months before getting a reply from creditors.    We are not interested in confrontation, but we would likethe loan mechanisms to show that the crisis belongs to bothsides, Funaro said.    Funaro denied rumours that he had offered his resignationto President Jose Sarney.    Who decides whether to keep or dismiss his ministers is thepresident. Everything else is nothing but speculation, he said."

  "title": "GERMAN WAGE ROUND SAID TO LIMIT MONETARY OPTIONS",
  "body": "The Bundesbanks options for WestGermany monetary policy are limited for the foreseeable futureby the delicate stage of wage negotiations between unions andemployers, economists and money market dealers said.    Call money fell in quite active trading today, dropping to3.4050 pct from 3.5565 pct yesterday, and below the 3.50 pcttreasury bill rate as a difficult monthend approached.    But dealers and economists said the Bundesbank was unlikelyto encourage lower rates in the foreseeable future largely forfear of upsetting the current wage round.    One money market dealer for a major foreign bank said, Idont think the Bundesbank wants rates to go up whateverhappens. But it also does not want them to fall. Above all itwants to wait to see how the unions wage round goes.    In West Germany, unions and employers prepare the groundfor triennial wage negotiations based on detailed assessmentsof growth and inflation, economists said.    Ute Geipel, economist with Citibank AG, said if theBundesbank became more accommodating in monetary policy,raising fears in some quarters of a return in inflation in themedium term, unions would be obliged to curtail wage demands.    As a result the Bundesbank was concerned to make no movethat would interfere in the negotiating process, Geipel said.    In the current round, the countrys most powerful union,the IG Metall representing metalworkers and engineers, isdemanding a shortening of the working week to 35 hours from thepresent 3812 and an accompanying five pct increase in wages.    The engineering employers association, Gesamtmetall, isoffering to bring in a 38hourweek from July 1, 1988, and givea two stage wage increase  a 2.7 pct rise from April 1 thisyear and another 1.5 pct from July 1, 1988.    The agreement forged by IG Metall  Europes largestunion, with 2.5 mln members  and the employers would set thebenchmark for settlements in other industries such as thepublic sector, banks and federal post office. Negotiationsbegan in December and unions are hopeful they may conclude byearly April, ahead of the traditional holiday period in June.    Though many economists said the unions current warningstrikes and rhetoric were part of the negotiating strategy andwould not lead to a repeat of 1984s damaging sevenweekstrikes, others said unions would not compromise greatly ontheir positions and there could still be conflict.    This could extend the length of time in which theBundesbank would keep its activity lowkey, economists said.    The money market head said the unions humiliation by theprotracted financial problems of the Neue Heimat cooperativehousing venture would contribute to union obstinacy.    The unions havent forgotten that and they will put thissquarely onto the account in the negotiations, he said.    In addition, the newlyelected chairman of the IG Metallunion, Franz Steinkuehler, was more radical and determined thanhis predecessor Hans Meyer and may be set for a longer battleto achieve the best possible settlement for his membership.    More than 16,000 engineering workers at 45 firms, mainly insouth Germany, held warning strikes lasting up to two hoursyesterday. Firms hit included Zahnradfabrik Passau GmbH andaerospace group MesserschmittBoelkowBlohm GmbH.    Today, 28,000 employees from 110 companies came out inwarning strikes, a statement from IG Metall said.    Money market dealers said that overnight call money rateswould rise in the near future in any case and did not depend ona politicallyinhibited Bundesbank.    About eight billion marks were coming into the markettomorrow from salary payments by the federal government.    As a result, some banks fell back on the Bundesbanks offerto mop up liquidity via the sale of threeday treasury bills,anticipating still lower rates before the monthend.    But a pension payment date by banks on behalf of customerswas due on Monday, other dealers noted. If banks were short ofliquidity until the bills matured on Tuesday, rates could soar,perhaps to the 5.50 pct Lombard ceiling.    Banks were well stocked up with funds, having an average52.1 billion marks in Bundesbank minimum reserves in the first24 days of March, well above the 50.7 billion requirement. REUTER3"

  "body": "Less than two months after FirstInterstate Bancorp withdrew its bold attempt to buy BankAmericaCorp, Chairman Joseph Pinola is still looking for a good buy,but he is also looking at ways to avoid being bought.    In a wideranging interview, Pinola said hes looking forways to improve profitability and capital between now and 1991,so as to resist any potential look at us...to maintain ourindependence, if possible.    In 1991 federal regulatory changes will allow the majorEast Coast banks to buy banks in California.    First Interstate, the fourth largest California bank, andthe nineth largest nationwide, owns 24 banks in 12 westernstates and has franchise operations in four additional states.    Bank industry sources say it is an attractive target forlarge U.S. or foreign banks, looking to quickly move into the lucrative California market and the West Coast region.    While declining specifics on his corporate strategy, whenasked if acquisitions will be part of the plan, Pinola replied,Thats undoubtedly a fair statement...it would be almost naivenot to think that.    Pinola characterized his acquisition strategy asopportunistic.    He said he will look for banks in management trouble thathe can get at a bargain, then add management to restoreprofitability, or for banks in states where First Interstatealready operates, then cut costs by combining resources.    The exception, he said, would be Texas, where he said mostof the banks are already well managed, but might be purchasedat a discount because of the depressed regional economy.    Pinola declined comment on what circumstances might movehim to rekindle his bid for BankAmerica, saying only, Wecontinue to monitor and look at a lot of things and a lot ofpeople continue to monitor and look at us.    Banking analysts, however, consider another FirstInterstate bid at BankAmerica a long shot, not likely to happenany time soon.    Pinola called his decision last month to withdraw his 3.25billion dlr bid at the nations second largest bank, a very,very difficult decision.    With that decision made, however, he acknowledged FirstInterstate may now have a difficult time keeping its numberfour position in the California banking community.    The competition in this state is tough, he said, notingCityBanks recent purchase of 50 financial service branchesfrom Sears Roebuck company. CityBank is moving rapidly to moveus down to fifth and Wells Fargo down to fourth, he said.    Outside California, Pinola acknowledged that SecurityPacific Corp, with its recent acquisitions in Arizona,Washington and Oregon, is quickly becoming a regionalcompetitor in areas where First Interstate has long dominated.    Security is, has been and continues to be a highlyprofitable and obviously well managed company, he said.    He added, however, First Interstate, at the moment, has theadvantages of having owned and managed regional banks longerand has the recognition advantage of having given its regionalbanks a common name.    Pinola said while its coastal state banks are in goodfinancial condition, First Interstate continues to sustainserious loan losses in its Rocky Mountain states, where energy,real estate and agriculture dominate the economy.    Asked if he thought loan losses in those areas had peaked,he said, I dont think it has bottomed out, because I thinkmost of the problems are real estaterelated and the realestate problems are going to be with us for several years.    Pinola said another failing economic sector, agriculture inthe Midwest, has slowed expansion of First Interstatesfranchise operation.    First Interstate has 42 franchise banks that offer FirstInterstate financial services in ten states.    While a year ago he was considering taking his franchiseoperation east of the Mississippi River, Pinola said becausemost of the franchise banks are now in the West, expansion intothe Midwest must come first.    Calling the franchise system, moderately profitable,Pinola said, It is going to take a rejuvenation of theagriculture sector for us to commence franchising at the speedwe were generating before the last year or two.    On the banking industry in general, Pinola said he thinks1987 will be another bad year for loan losses, with only bankswith minimal holdings in real estate able to improve profits."

  "body": "Brazil today suggested to its foreignbank creditors an extension of shortterm credit lines for 60days until May 31, a spokesman for the Central Bank said.    He said that with the move, called a standstillarrangement, Brazil was only trying to avoid difficulties inpaying its 109 billion dlrs of debt in the future.    The spokesman told Reuters that Brazils suggestion will becommunicated by telex to Brazils 700 bank creditors. Hedeclined to give details of the statement, but said CentralBank president Francisco Gros was seeking a 60day extension ofshortterm credit lines from its commercial bank creditors.    The amount of these credit lines totals 15 billion dlrs,and deadline for payment is set for March 31.    Finance Minister Dilson Funaro said in a televisioninterview that it was absolutely important for Brazil and itscreditors to renew the shortterm credit lines, as Brazil mustfinance its exports.    If these credit lines were cut, we would face difficultiesto honour our foreign debt in the future, Funaro said.    There is evidently a common interest in the matter, hesaid.    Funaro said, however, he was told creditors understandBrazils position and do not wish to make the negotiation forthe renewal of the credit lines more difficult.    Funaro explained that Brazils suggestion is part of itsdemands before the need to renew the mechanisms of loans in theworld.    He said that the current negotiating process is verycomplex and complicated, mentioning cases of countries whichhad to wait some 10 months before getting a reply fromcreditors.    We are not interested in confrontation, but we would likethe loan mechanisms to show that the crisis belongs to bothsides, Funaro said.    Funaro denied rumours that he had offered his resignationto President Jose Sarney.    Who decides whether to keep or dismiss his ministers is thepresident. Everything else is nothing but speculation, he said.    Brazil last month suspended interest payments on its 68billion dlrs of debt to commercial banks and froze shorttermtrade and money market lines. REUTER3"

  "body": "As pressure mounted on British PrimeMinister Margaret Thatcher to call a June election, she saidtoday that the decision on when to go to the county was hersand hers alone.    She was speaking to parliament after senior members of theruling Conservative Party urged her to call elections due inJune 1988 a year early in the wake of two more opinion pollsgiving her party a commanding lead.    Asked by a Conservative backbencher for an assurance thatthe decision was hers alone, and did not depend on media hype,pressure and speculation, she replied The date of the nextelection will be decided by Downing Street, not Fleet Street.    Downing Street is the Prime Ministers official residence,Fleet Street the traditional home of the British nationalpress.    A Harris poll for the breakfasttime program TVAM gave theTories 43 pct of the vote, representing a majority of 132 seatsin parliament, their biggest lead since the partys landslidevictory in the 1983 elections.    In The Times of London, a MORI poll gave the Tories a 92seat majority. It was the sixth poll to show the ruling partywith a big lead over the opposition Labour Party and thefastimproving centrist Alliance.    Leading the chorus urging Thatcher to go to the polls inJune, Sir Marcus Fox, vicechairman of the influential 1922committee of Conservative backbenchers, said I have alwaysfelt that it would be June, and this reinforces my view.    I always thought June was right. We have got most of ourlegislation through and to go beyond that I do not think wouldbe in the national interest.    Another Tory backbencher, Anthony BeaumontDark, said Ihave always been an October man, but I think it would be goodto get it out of the way now.    Their comments came as government officials dismissedspeculation about a snap election to coincide with local pollsin May, timed to reap maximum advantage from the recentpopularity surge, Thatchers successful trip to Moscow andLabours current popularity slump.    Calls for a May poll were also prompted by Tory concernover a steady advance by the Alliance, and the possibility thatif it continues it could rob the Conservatives of an overallmajority in parliament.    Todays MORI poll showed an Alliance gain of eight pointsover the past month in around 100 key marginal seats where theoutcome of the next election is likely to be decided."

The dollar closed at 1.826575 marks after opening at1.820015 and closing yesterday at 1.826070.    Volcker said that a further sizeable dollar decline couldbe counterproductive, and that exchange rate adjustments havebeen enough to narrow the U.S. Trade deficit.    Such remarks in the past might have moved the dollarsharply, today they only pushed it up 20 or 30 basis pointswhen it was already firming for technical reasons.    The dollar in any case held in a narrow range today,trading early in the morning just below 1.82 marks and risingto a high of 1.8270.    Dealers said they were awaiting comments after the G5meeting from U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker.    Looking slightly further ahead, the market is awaiting U.S.February trade data, due on April 14.    Another set of disappointing figures could push the dollarbelow its recent 1.8085 mark range if there have been nosupportive statements from G5 officials in Washington in themeantime, dealers said.    Sterling closed slightly easier at 2.950954 marks, afteropening at 2.951955 and closing yesterday at 2.954958.    The pound has been buoyed by expectations the rulingConservatives will win the next U.K. Election.    But dealers said sterling now looks high against the markand room for further gains must be limited.    Many dealers believe sterling will enter the EMS jointfloat after a U.K. Election. In this case, its ceiling couldwell be at or near 2.95 marks, dealers said.    The yen closed at 1.255070 marks per 100 after closingyesterday at 1.24902510, and the Swiss franc firmed to120.5570 marks per 100 from 120.1050.    The French franc ended unchanged at 30.0407 marks per 100. REUTER3"

  "body": "The records in turnover set by the LondonInternational Financial Futures Exchange LIFFE in March couldbe surpassed in the coming months, Liffe Chief ExecutiveMichael Jenkins said.    Last month, Liffe saw record monthly futures volume at 1.15mln lots, and record monthly options volume at 97,700. TotalLiffe volume in first quarter 1987 rose to 2.8 mln contracts,or 89 pct up on the same 1986 period.    Long gilt turnover in first quarter 1987 was 300 pct up onthe yearago period at 1.63 mln lots versus 409,500. But Tbondvolume fell by 38 pct to 244,500 in first three months 1987.    Jenkins told Reuters the higher volumes for gilts reflectedin part the volatility in the U.K. Markets in recent months,while the falloff in Tbonds was an indication of the relativestability of U.S. Credit markets.    Jenkins said he saw room for the whole financial futuressector to grow further in the coming months. In particular, FTSE 100 futures had great scope for expansion, and turnover inthem should be much higher by end 1987.    FTSE futures volume was 62,700 in first quarter 1987, anincrease of 124 pct over the 28,000 contracts recorded in thesame months of 1986.    Institutions here had been slow to find out about the useof stock exchange futures, but they would now learn more,Jenkins predicted.    Commenting on the difference in popularity between giltsand bonds, Jenkins said Liffe had designed the widest possiblevariety of contracts so that at any given time, at least onesector would be volatile enough to attract trading. The currentsituation of U.S. Markets being steady, and U.K. Oneschangeable, might alter completely in coming months.    A further boost to Liffes volume and attractiveness shouldcome with the introduction of yen bond futures, he added. REUTER3"

ADB president Babacar NDiaye released a 1987 economicreport on Africa prepared by the ADB and the U.N.

He said an adhoc committee of the ADB board of governors,comprising 18 African and nonAfrican countries, recommended a200 pct increase in the organisations capital for 198791.

  "title": "SWEDISH FINANCE FIRMS SEEN HIT BY DEREGULATION",
  "body": "Up to 70 pct of the 240 financecompanies operating in Sweden are likely to be squeezed outover the next few years by the deregulation of financialmarkets, the Association of Swedish Finance Companies said.    Association chairman Arne Ogren told a news conference thata major restructuring of the sector was inevitable.    Central Bank governor Bengt Dennis said when announcing thederegulation in November 1985 that one of his main aims was togive commercial banks a chance to compete on equal terms withfinance companies and so undermine Swedens grey market.    Total credit granted by the Swedish finance companies roseto 77 billion crowns in 1986 from 64.7 billion in 1985. Thisincludes leasing and is the equivalent of 19 pct of alloutstanding loans by the banking sector at end1986.    Ogren said that if proposals now being discussed by agovernmentappointed inquiry into the credit market to licensefinance companies and make them increase their share capitalwere pushed through, up to 70 pct would disappear.    But he said this would in fact have little effect on creditvolumes as the 42 biggest finance companies accounted for 70pct of lending by the entire sector.    The explosive growth of Swedish finance companies began inthe early 1970s and commercial banks even started their own toget around the tight restrictions then imposed on bankingactivities and particularly on the growth of lending.    Now that they were on an equal footing with their parentcompanies, many bankowned finance companies faced an identitycrisis, Ogren said. He predicted there would be mergers andindividual firms would carve out specialised niches to ensuretheir survival in a deregulated climate.    Ogren said the sectors losses on bad loans were bound torise steeply in 19891990 due to the rush to increase credit. REUTER3"

  "body": "The inflow of longterm capital intoWest Germany slumped to 606 mln marks in February fromJanuarys record 11.91 billion, with foreign purchases ofGerman bonds and shares declining sharply, the Bundesbank said.    While foreigners bought only four billion marks worth ofGerman bonds in February after 13 billion in January, they solda net 500 mln marks in shares and promissory notes of publicauthorities after sales worth 300 mln in January.    With German investors purchases of foreign securitiessteady around 1.3 billion marks, only 2.2 billion marks wereimported through securities transactions, after 11.2 billion.    Direct investment abroad led to a capital outflow of 1.60billion marks in February after 2.83 billion in January.    There was a deficit of 8.14 billion marks in the shorttermcapital account after a surplus of 194 mln in January.    Banks alone exported some 8.6 billion marks in funds whiledomestic companies increased their shortterm financial assetsabroad by 700 mln. But public authorities received some onebillion marks from abroad, the Bundesbank said in a statement.    Combining long and short term capital outflows, WestGermany recorded a net outflow of 7.53 billion marks inFebruary against a net inflow of 11.91 billion in January.    The Bundesbank confirmed the German trade surplus widenedto 10.45 billion marks in February from Januarys 7.20 billion.    Taking the two months together the seasonally adjustedsurplus was slightly below the figure for the previous two. Interms of current as well as constant prices, the narrowing ofthe surplus was progressing, the bank said.    Germanys current account surplus widened to 6.63 billionmarks in February from 4.79 billion in January, but was down onthe 7.26 billion figure for February 1986. Seasonally adjusted,the February current account surplus narrowed against January.    While exports in February fell a half pct against the samemonth last year, imports fell 1012 pct largely due to thedrop in prices. Exports grew three pct in volume and importstwo pct.    In the balance of services, a fall in net investment incomeled to a 300 mln mark deficit in February after a 300 mln marksurplus in January.    The deficit in transfer payments widened to 3.70 billionmarks from 2.69 billion, largely due to a sharp jump to 2.3billion marks from 200 mln in payments to the EuropeanCommunity budget. REUTER3"

They said last weeks cereals management committee agreedto release 70,000 tonnes of feed wheat through weekly tendersbetween April 14 and May 26. It also indicated it planned toallow the release of another 30,000 tonnes from April 23.    However, it decided to leave consideration of the releaseof further wheat until later.    The British government had applied for the release of afurther 100,000 tonnes in both May and June from Britishintervention stores to prevent market prices rising.    However, the sources said, the Commission wanted to reviewthe market situation nearer the time before giving itsapproval.    The Commission was given new powers last year to controlthe release of intervention cereals onto the market, thesources noted.    Following last weeks committee meeting, the U.K. Ministryof Agriculture said the Commission had given an assurance thatadditional quantities of intervention wheat would be madeavailable in May and June. It also said that it was envisagedthat monthly releases would be at least 100,000 tonnes,depending on the state of the market.    This lead to the widespread assumption that the Commissionhad actually approved the release of 300,000 tonnes during thethree months of April, May and June at last weeks meeting."

  "title": "JAPAN CUTS CHIP SUPPLY, MAY PRODUCE SHORTAGE",
  "body": "Japan is attempting to cut backsemiconductor production to forstall the 300 mln dlrs in U.S.tariffs on Japanese electronic goods set to take effect April17, industry analysts said.    The move is likely to create a sharp price rise and apossible shortage of the key computer components in the nextfew weeks, the analysts said.    Prices have gone up for memory components, the mainstay ofthe Japanese semiconductor industry, analyst Drew Peck ofDonaldson Lufkin and Jenrette said.    But analysts said the price rises have been slight so far,and some questioned whether Japan would be successful inforcing Japanese companies to cut production in the long run.    Others, however, were more optimistic, saying evidence wasalready in hand that Japan has cut back prodution and haltedsales to the grey market, the third country brokers that sellchips at below production costs.    Weve seen the grey market begin to dry up for DRAMS, andit has virtually dried up for EPROMS, said Merrill Lynchanalyst Thomas Kurlack of the two key memory chips used incomputers.    Prices are inching up and lead times on deliveries arestretching, Kurlack added.    Industry analysts said Japans Ministry of InternationalTrade and Industry, or MITI, had requested the cut backs inproduction to meet the terms of last years semiconductoraccord with the U.S.    The Reagan adminsitration recently proposed tariffs onJapanese electronic goods, alleging that Japan had failed tolive up to the accord and continued to dump the computercomponents in the U.S. market.    But some analysts said Japans attempt to mollify the U.S.was a double edged sword, and might be read at a subtle form oftrade retaliation for the tariffs proposed by the U.S.    As production in Japan is cut, these analysts argue, priceswill rise in the U.S. and few American semiconductormanufactures will be able to take up the slack since most longago exited the market for memory chips. U.S. computer makersthat use the chips in their machines will then be pressured.    The Japanese are looking for ways to reduce tradepressures from Washington, but at the same time theyredemonstating their muscle, analyst Peck said.    The cut backs in Japanese production are expected tobenefit U.S. chip makers.    I think this could be a very important factor for U.S.semiconductor manufacturers, industry analyst Elliot Levine ofLadenburg Thalmann Co said.    But analyst Peck said, it will take a few weeks to seewhether Japan has genuinely cut production.    He said Japanese manufactures were likely to view MITIsrequest unfavorably because chip capacity was still high andproduction cut backs would lead to significant writeoffs inplant and equipment."

Speaking at a House agriculture subcommittee hearing on theuse of the certificates, Amstutz said that the issuance of 8.5billion dlrs of certificates during fiscal years 198688 couldresult in government outlays of up to 400 mln dlrs.    However, the use of certificates preclude the need for 450to 500 mln dlrs in storage and handling costs, resulting in netsavings for the government of 50100 mln dlrs, he said.    Without the use of certificates, Amstutz said nearly theentire 1985 crop which had been put under loan would have beenforfeited to the Commodity Credit Corporation, CCC.    In addition, 260 mln bushels of grain that have beenredeemed from CCC inventory through certificate exchanges wouldhave remained in the goverment inventory, he said.    When asked to comment on a recent study by the GeneralAccounting Office that concluded certificates result in a netcost to the government, Amstutz said, GAO underestimated thebenefits and overstated the costs of the certificate program.    Amstutz said while certificates encourage more loanentries, they also encourage heavier loan redemptions ratherthan forfeitures.    GAO underestimated this net loan activity, Amstutz said.    There is no question in the mind of the Department ofAgriculture that these certificates have been very useful,Amstutz said.    Immediate benefits of certificates include greater marketliquidity, improved market price competitiveness, higher farmincome, and improved debt situation and decreased carryingcosts, he said.    Certificates are an integral part of USDAs longrangemarketoriented farm policy, he said.    Amstutz told subcommittee Chairman Rep. Dan Glickman,DKans., that USDA is in the process of preparing an officialresponse to the GAO study on certificates and will submit it tothe subcommittee when completed."

  "body": "More generic grain certificatesshould be released onto the market in order for the U.S.certificate program to have its full effect on commodities,according to a study by Sparks Commodities Inc.    The Agriculture Department should make grain deficiencypayments and paid land diversion payments in a twothirdcertificate, onethird cash ratio through fiscal year 1989, Carroll Brunthaver, president of Sparks Commodities, told aHouse agriculture subcommittee hearing on certificates.    Thereafter, government payments should be issued in roughlya 5050 split between cash and certificates, Brunthaver said.    The Sparks study on certificates examined two possiblescenarios through the 1990 growing season  a zerocertificate case, where no certificate program was assumed,and an alternative case labeled adequate certificate case inwhich sufficient certificates would be released so that grainprices would not be artificially supported by market shortagesdue to acreage reduction programs or government holdings.    The study showed that total grain use under the adequatecertificate scenario would exceed the zero certificate scenarioby 11.2 pct.    Usage would be markedly more in 1989 and 1990, when grainusage under a certificate program was estimated to exceed thezero certificate case by 15 to 19 pct.    For the fiveyear period examined, government expendituresunder the adequate certificate case were 7.0 billion dlrs, or7.5 pct less than under the zero certificate case.    The Sparks study said that 5.1 billion dlrs, or 70 pct ofthose savings resulted from smaller government storage costs.    The study also estimated that government grain stocks underthe adequate certificate case would be 4.7 billion bushelsbelow the zero certificate case at the end of the periodexamined.    The Sparks study said that while certificates permit marketprices to fall below loan levels, these lower prices increasecommodity usage and reduce the net costs of certificates versuscash."

  "body": "The executive committee of the Italiannational banking association ABI, representing the countrysmajor credit institutions, approved the setting up of a commonreserve fund to guarantee customer deposits in the event ofbank failures.    ABI chairman Giannino Parravicini told a news conferencethat the fund would not be operative until the latter part of1987, and only on condition that 60 pct of banks representingat least 75 pct of total deposits participated.    He said the fund would initially have 1,000 billion lireavailable and would cover deposits of up to three billion lire.    A statute for establishing a deposit guarantee fund hasalready been approved by the Bank of Italy and by aninterministerial committee on credit and savings.    The 1,000 billion lire initial funding, which will beprovided through contributions from banks which opt to join thescheme, compares with an originally targetted figure of 4,000billion lire.    Parravicini said the fund would be gradually increased to4,000 billion lire by end 1991, and that the decision toachieve this figure gradually rather than immediately was dueto fiscal considerations.    The fund, still to be formally ratified by ABIs steeringcommittee, will provide 100 pct coverage on deposits of up to200 mln lire, 90 pct on deposits between 200 mln and onebillion lire and 80 pct on those between one billion and threebillion lire.    Assuming that all banks join the fund, contributions wouldbe equivalent to around 0.25 pt of a banks total deposits.    The ABIs steering committee later unanimously ratified theexecutive committees decision to create the common reservefund. REUTER3"

The talks began in Washington yesterday and Tanjug said thegeneral attitude of the banks was favourable.    At the same time, other Tanjug reports showed Yugoslavia ishaving difficulties in obtaining a 600 mln ECU loan from theEuropean Community EC and in receiving money owed to Yugoslavfirms by Middle Eastern countries.    The Western creditor governments and Kuwait agreed on March31 to refinance 475 mln dlrs of Yugoslavias debt due in 1987and 1988. This made possible the talks with commercial banks.    Tanjug said sources close to the Yugoslav delegation saidthe initial reaction of commercial banks was favourable despitetheir continued insistence on technical and legal elements.    It said it was believed that a commercial debt reschedulingwould be formally agreed in the next few weeks. Bank debtaccounts for about 70 pct of Yugoslavias overall debt, whichstood at 19.7 billion dlrs at end1986.    Tanjug said Yugoslavia also discussed with its commercialcreditors the idea of converting some of Yugoslavias debt intojoint venture investments but it gave no details of this.    It said Deputy Finance Minister Boris Skapin was holdingtalks on this with representatives of Manufacturers HanoverTrust Co., Which coordinates the interests of several hundredbanks in Yugoslav debt negotiations.    In a separate report Tanjug said the EC has so far refuseda Yugoslav request for a 600 mln ECU infrastuctural loan and a100 mln ECU grant from the EC budget. The EC had so far onlyagreed to provide 380 mln ECUs towards transport modernisation.    It said Yugoslav Finance Minister Svetozar Rikanovicyesterday met World Bank and International Monetary Fundofficials in Washington.    It said the World Bank agreed that infrastructural projectsin Yugoslavia should be accelerated and structural adjustmentloans should be agreed this year. REUTER3"

  "body": "The dollar remained on the defensive insubdued dealings with few traders willing to take any majorrisks ahead of this weeks international monetary meetings inWashington, dealers said.    Everybody is waiting for developments from the talks. Inthe meantime, its just jobbing positions back and forth, saida dealer at one U.S. bank.    The Group of Five, comprising the U.S., Japan, WestGermany, France and the U.K., are scheduled to convene today.    The dollar hovered at 145.2530 yen, down from 145.8590last night, and eased to 1.825560 marks from 1.826070.    The stage for the dollars decline was set overnight in theFar East where the U.S. currency retreated despite steadyintervention on its behalf by the Bank of Japan.    Dealers in Japan cited speculation that the G5G7 talksare unlikely to produce any significant or lasting measures tostabilize currencies as one reason for the selloff.    No central bank intervention was detected in the U.S. wherethe dollar kept well within recent trading parameters.    Despite the view that trade and economic imbalances dictatea downward course for the dollar, few U.S. dealers wished tosell it aggressively before this weeks meetings.    Statements by Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volckerduring testimony before the Senate Banking Committe failed torouse the market from its inertia.    Volcker reiterated that a further, sizeable dollar declinemay be counterproductive. He also said that currency changesthat have occurred so far should be large enough  in acontext of a growing world economy and fiscal restraint in theU.S.  to support expectations for a narrower U.S. trade gap.    There was nothing new or remarkable there, said a dealerat one European bank. The dollars brief rise to 1.8270 markswas already underway when Volcker spoke, he added.    With the dollar becalmed, dealers looked to crossrates,especially sterling, yen and Swiss franc, for interest.    Sterling continued to benefit from U.K. public opinionpolls indicating a lead for the ruling Conservative party inany general election and following signals of an improvedeconomy.    The pound hovered at 1.617585 dlrs, unchanged from Monday,and at 2.955 marks, off slightly from about 2.955 last night.

The broader marketshowed less vigor, however, as advances eked out a lead overdeclines. Volume was a strong 106 mln shares.   Ford, up over a point for most of the session, stood at9058, up 12.

Chrysler, not expected tomake any major announcements this week, fell 12 to 5734.    With the bonds weak this morning, the blue chips have beenholding the market up and that advance was sustained by aninflux of foreign money, analyst Charles Jensen of MKISecurities said.

Bills improved slightly on remarks from Federal Reservechairman Paul Volcker that a restrictive monetary policy wouldbe damaging to investment and that last weeks increases inU.S. banks prime lending rates to 7.75 pct from 7.50 pct wasnot connected with Fed policy, dealers said.     Coupon issues were 132 to 516 lower, pressured by a weakdollar. Treasury bill rates were anywhere from three basispoints lower to one basis point higher.    The key 712 pct Treasury bond was 516 lower at 952632to yield 7.87 pct compared with 7.84 pct at yesterdays close.    Dealers said remarks from Federal Reserve Chairman PaulVolcker indicating that exchange rates had adjusted enough tonarrow the U.S. trade deficit and warning that a further,sizable dollar fall could be counterproductive had littleexchange rate impact as they were seen as a reiteration of hisviews.    In any case, they said the dollar is expected to be underpressure while monetary officials of leading industrial nationsmeet this week in Washington, which may hurt bonds.    Dealers said threemonth bill rates had eased early in thesession on a few sizable buy orders from retail accounts, butthat otherwise there was little activity in this sector.    When Volcker hit the tape it helped bills, because itmakes people think the Fed is not going to tighten, a billtrader said. But its a nervous trade, with no real buyers.    Threemonth bills were bid at 5.50 pct, three basis pointsbelow their price at yesterdays auction, while sixmonth billsrose one basis point from their auction price to 5.64 pct bid.    Year bills rose one basis points to 5.74 pct bid.    Most economists expected the Federal Reserve to supplytemporary reserves, but most had forecasted an indirectinjection via customer repurchase agreements rather than adirect injection via twoday system repurchases which the Fedconducted at its usual intervention time.    The Fed intervened when Federal funds were trading at 618pct. Funds opened at this level and remained there at midday,down from yesterdays 6.20 pct avearge.    The 638 pct twoyear notes fell 132 to 992132 atmidday and the 714 pct 10years dropped 932 to 972732."

  "title": "U.S. IMMIGRATION RULES SPARK CONGRESS OBJECTIONS",
  "body": "New immigration rules relating toalien farm workers and reportedly being drafted by the U.S.Agriculture Department are meeting with objections in Congress,sources on Capitol Hill said.    USDA is drafting regulations, required by a 1986 law, thatwould offer amnesty to illegal aliens if they worked in thecultivation of fruits, vegetables and other perishablecommodities.    The department is considering including in its definitionof perishable commodities such farm products as tobacco, hops,Spanish reeds and Christmas trees, while excluding sugar cane,the New York Times reported yesterday.    Rep. Howard Berman, DCalif., would like to see thedefinition extended to include sugar cane, cultivation of whichis a breeding ground for one of the scandals of the nation,Gene Smith, a spokesman for Berman, said.    Livestock, dairy and poultry producers have been lobbyingUSDA hard to have their products covered by the amnestyprovision, farm industry sources said.    Chuck Fields of the American Farm Bureau Federation saidlivestock producers were desperate because they fear they willbe unable to retain the many illegal aliens who have joinedthat industry.    A House staff member involved in drafting the landmark 1986immigration law who asked not to be identified said Congressdid not mean to extend special amnesty provisions to workerswho helped cultivate tobacco, and that inclusion of hops andSpanish reeds was marginal.    In addition, lawmakers made it clear during considerationof the bill that lumber workers were not to be covered by thethe amnesty provisions, making the inclusion of Christmas treesa tough call, this source said.    USDA officials declined to comment on the draft regulationexcept to say it was subject to change before it will bereleased, probably some time later this month.    While lawmakers may object to the USDA rule underconsideration relating to perishable commodities, Congress isnot likely to reopen debate on the controversial immigrationquestion, congressional sources said.    The amnesty provision specially designed for farm workerswas crucial to passage of the overall immigration bill.    Congressional staff members estimate the special farmworker amnesty provision would apply to between 250,000 to350,000 aliens. The law would allow eligible farm workers whoworked for 90 days during the year ending May 1, 1986, to applyfor temporary, then permanent, resident status."

Neither Castro nor the Cuban press have given out figuresto estimate tonnes of crude production during the presentharvest or the goals for the sugar campaign.    However, a cuban sugar official told Reuters that thecountry will be lucky if crude output reaches last years 7.2mln tonnes. Output of crude for the previous 198485 harvestwas 8.2 mln tonnes.

The telephone company said it asked the PSC on Nov. 7 forpermission to increase its prices for intrastate private lineservices, used mainly by large business customers, which ATTsaid were priced below its access costs.    Private line service has been grossly underpriced since1984, and, therefore, it has been subsidized by all longdistance users, Terry Hobbs, assistant vice president said.    As a result of todays PSC decision to allow our privateline service prices to cover their access costs, thesesubsidies will end and well be able to reduce basic longdistance rates for everyone, he added."

  "body": "U.S. trade representative ClaytonYeutter said that if Congress were to require traderetaliation, it would only close markets and would result inless trade.    In remarks prepared for an address to members of theUniversity of Chicagos Graduate School of Business, Yeuttersaid many Congressional proposals do not appear to be overtlyprotectionist, yet their undeniable effect would be to closeoff market opportunitites, just as exchange rate movement isunleashing such opportunities for the first time in severalyears.    Despite all our progress on trade policy and despite thePresidents comprehensive competitiveness initiative, there aremany in Congress who still are supporting trade billscontaining many dangerous provisions, Yuetter said.    Yeutter said many countries would prefer U.S. retaliationto opening their own markets. We should be intelligent enoughto not let them off the hook that easily, he said.    He said that tough but flexible legislative language isinfinitely preferable to tough but inflexible language.    Both House and Senate trade proposals place undesirablelimits on Presidential discretion, he said.    Limiting the Presidents ability to consider all availableoptions on issues as sensitive as these would be most unwise,Yeutter said. That could readily provoke retaliation, whichwould unneccesarily embroil us in trade wars, injuring mostcompetitive export industries.    Yeutter said present U.S. trade laws are fundamentallysound.    President Reagan has threatened or implemented retaliationeight times in the last 18 months  most recently in the caseof Japanese semiconductors being dumped in world markets.    He took these steps as a last resort, only after carefullyanalyzing all the contingencies on a case by case basis andonly after determining that such actions would open markets toAmerican exports, he said.    Yeutter said it would be foolish to attempt to solve theU.S. trade deficit by focusing on trade policy alone. He addedthat the trade deficit was created primarily by macroeconomicpolicy shortcomings here and abroad."

  "body": "Brazil has set up a special debtcommission, headed by Finance Minister Dilson Funaro, to beresponsible for renegotiating Brazils 109 billion dollarforeign debt, officials said.    The principal negotiator on the commission, created byPresident Jose Sarney, will be former foreign minister RamiroSaraiva Guerreiro.    Officials said Guerreiro would be joined on the commissionby eight senior officials, including a representative of theNational Security Council.    The creation of the commission is intended to underscorethe Brazilian governments contention that the debt issue isessentially political and that a political solution must befound to the problem.    On February 20 Brazil suspended interest payments on its 68billion dollar foreign bank debt to try to force the issue.    Creditor banks, however, have signalled that they areequally determined to resist Brazils demands for debt relief.    Yesterday Funaro travelled to the United States for freshdebt negotiations with creditors deeply angered by Brasiliassuspension of interest payments.    Funaro was due to hold talks in New York today with theprivate sector, before travelling to Washington for the semiannual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the WorldBank.    Officials said the new commission would start work inearnest when Funaro returns from the United States.    Yesterday Funaro called for a new forum for discussion ofthe foreign debt. He suggested direct participation of thegovernments of creditor countries in debt talks.    In negotiations on commercial debt, talks havetraditionally been restricted to banks.    The creation of the new commission brings Brazils highlyprofessional Foreign Ministry much more into the forefront onthe debt issue than it has been in the past.    During the period of military rule, which ended in 1985,the Foreign Ministry played a very minor role in debt policy.    But the new commission has diplomats among its members andthe chief negotiator, Saraiva Guerreiro, is a seasoned envoywith a long diplomatic career."

They made the filing in the First Court of Appeals inTexas, said John Jeffers, an attorney at the Houston law firmof Baker and Botts representing Pennzoil.    A Spokesman for Texaco had no immediate comment. Attorneysrepresenting Texaco were not immediately available.    The filing follows yesterdays decision by the U.S. SupremeCourt, overturning a lower federal court decision that had cutTexacos bond to one billion dlrs. The high court ruled thatthe issue should first be considered by Texas state courts.    Texaco yesterday said it would soon file to preventenforcement of the bond, but it was unsure whether it wouldmake the filing in a District Court, the Court of Appeals orthe Texas Supreme Court.    Jeffers said Texaco chose the Appeals Court because itcurrently has jurisdiction in the case.    According to Texas state law, Texaco could be forced topost the full amount of the judgement as a bond. If it failedto do so, Pennzoil could seek liens on Texacos assets for theamount of the judgement.    Texacos filing contains a request to cut the amount of thebond to between one and 1.5 billion dlrs, Jeffers said. Askedwhat Pennzoils thought of that amount, he said, I dont thinkits enough.    Pennzoil has repeatedly said it would not seek to forceTexaco to post the full amount of the judgement in the form ofa bond, but has said it would seek other forms of security.    Weve recognized there are other alternatives to a bond,Jeffers, the Pennzoil attorney, said.    Pennzoil will also have the right to respond to the filingbut Jeffers said he was unsure when the response would be made.    The dispute between Texaco and Pennzoil stems from the 1984takeover of Getty Oil Co by Texaco. Pennzoil said the mergerviolated a prior agreement it had to buy Getty and sued Texaco.Since then, Pennzoils position has twice been upheld by TexasState Courts. The Judgement now stands at 10.3 billion dlrs,including interest, and is on appeal."

  "title": "BRAZILS DEBT CRISIS BECOMING POLITICAL CRISIS",
  "body": "Brazils financial crisis is rapidlybecoming a political and social crisis, and President JoseSarney faces increasingly serious questions about his future.    As Brazil enters debt talks with creditors in the UnitedStates this week, political analysts say Sarneysadministration has never appeared weaker.    The full political price which Sarney will have to pay forthe failure of the muchvaunted antiinflation Cruzado Plan isstill not clear. He might have to pay with the presidency.    Calls are increasing for direct presidential elections topick a successor to Sarney early next year. The length of histerm will be decided by a Constituent Assembly, and Sarney hasbeen lobbying for a sixyear term.    Sarney came to power, without facing presidentialelections, in March 1985, when the military bowed out after 21years of rule.    Although there was wide public support for direct elections for president, the military as one of their lastacts, insisted an electoral college, where it felt it had moreinfluence, make the choice.    The college chose Tancredo Neves, a popular politician whoheaded the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party PMDB, whichhad opposed military rule.    In part to smooth relations with the military, Neves choseSarney, a supporter of the generals, for the purely ceremonialpost of vicepresident. But Neves died before he could takeoffice and Sarney took power.    He won the grudging support of the PMDB and the CruzadoPlan was wildly popular with inflationweary Brazilians.    But the Cruzado Plan failed and politics in Brazil has notbeen the same.    The country is a rudderless ship, said a U.S. Diplomat,echoing a common view that the government lacks any clear ideaof how to tackle the economic crisis.    Sarney has appeared increasingly isolated, with criticismcoming from the business community, the trade unions, some ofthe military, the media and political opponents.    Many businessmen are unhappy with Sarneys decisionannounced on February 20 to suspend interest payments on 68billion dlrs of foreign debt.    A motor industry executive said The business communitythinks Brazil should go to the IMF. Their rules are sometimesharsh and strict, but this is the only way to put the house inorder.    Trade unions generally support the debt moratorium, butdisagree with other aspects of government policy. Since the endof February they have organized national strikes of seamen,bankworkers and federal university teachers and countless localstoppages and protests.    Economic problems have prompted criticism from somemilitary figures, including the last army ruler, General JoaoFigueiredo. It is a sign of the times that almost dailymilitary men deny there is going to be a coup.    If the army does stay in the barracks, the key arbitors ofSarneys fate will be the PMDBs leaders. So far, they have nottaken a clear stand on the issue of direct elections.    But one PMDB leader, Senator Affonso Camargo, pointedlysaid yesterday that it was the sovereign right of theConsituent Assembly to call direct elections for the presidencywhenever it wished.    In the media, Sarney has to contend with strong criticism.    One senior political commentator, Fernando Pedreira of theJornal do Brasil, wrote in the newspaper last week    President Sarney is ... a man of good intentions, but itis just possible that he himself is not aware of the true stateof the country and the people since the immense failure of theCruzado Plan.    The disappointment, the frustration, the irritation, theenticement have been and continue to be too great, tooprofound.He called for direct elections early in 1988 as theonly way out of the present crisis.    One of Sao Paulos leading news magazines, Senhor, said inan editorial this week The anarchopopulist government ofPresident Jose Sarney has failed. Two years have already beentoo long for such a disastrous experience.    It deserves to be buried as quickly as possible. Thenatural solution direct elections soon.    The governments inability to control inflation is nowbringing with it serious social problems.    An explosion in rents in Sao Paulo has thrown tens ofthousands of families onto the streets because they can nolonger afford to pay even for a wooden shack in the slums.    The local press says the city is experiencing the biggestwave of land invasions in its history.   According to rental agencies, rents have increased 500 pctin little more than a year. Even the cheapest shacks now cost2,000 cruzados 90 dollars a month, half as much again as theminimum wage, which is all that many earn.    Cardinal Paulo Evaristo Arns, the Roman Catholic archbishopof Sao Paulo, warned yesterday of the possibility of a socialconflict of unimaginable proportions.    With his back to the wall politically and with socialtensions rising, Sarney is no position to compromise on debt."

The principal negotiator on the commission, created byPresident Jose Sarney, will be former foreign minister RamiroSaraiva Guerreiro.    Officials said Guerreiro would be joined on the commissionby eight senior officials, including a representative of theNational Security Council.    The creation of the commission is intended to underscorethe Brazilian governments contention that the debt issue isessentially political and that a political solution must befound to the problem.    On February 20 Brazil suspended interest payments on its 68billion dlr foreign bank debt to try to force the issue.    Creditor banks, however, have signalled that they areequally determined to resist Brazils demands for debt relief.

  "body": "The dollar ended with modest net lossesagainst most major currencies as the market conducted a finalround of positionsquaring ahead of tomorrows crucial Group ofFive and Group of Seven meetings, dealers said.    The dollar was trendless today. People are waiting to seeif anything new comes from the meetings tomorrow and will thentake it from there, said one dealer at a top European bank.    As a result, generally supportive comments by FederalReserve Chairman Paul Volcker and Japanese Finance MinisterKiichi Miyazawa went largely unheeded.    The dollar closed at 145.6070 yen, down from 145.8590.    However, the dollars yen closing level was comfortablyabove its overseas low of just under 145 yen. Against the mark,the dollar finished at 1.827080 marks after falling to 1.8180in Europe and ending at 1.826070 here yesterday.    In Congressional testimony this morning, Fed Chairman PaulVolcker harped on his longheld fears about the potentiallycatastrophic fallout from a sharp dollar decline.    He also said the dollars fall, thus far, should be largeenough, in a context of a growing world economy and fiscalrestraint in the U.S., to support widespread expectations of anarrowing in the real trade deficit in the period ahead.    The market impact of Volckers comments was minimal. Itwas the same old story. Volcker was just fulfilling his role asa defender of the currency, said one trader.    The market was similarly dismissive of Japanese FinanceMinister Kiichi Miyazawas upbeat appraisal of his hourlongconversation with U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker thisafternoon.    Miyazawa said that they both agreed on the need forcurrency stabilization and that he was satisfied with the rolethe U.S. has played in coordinated international efforts toprop up the dollar since the late February Paris agreement.    Miyazawa can talk until hes blue in the face. The onlyperson who will make a difference is Baker, said Alan Rose ofFirst Interstate Bank in Los Angeles.    The key question for the currency market is whether theReagan administration will have a change of view on thedollar. If not, the dollar is going lower, he added.    The dollars recent tumble to a 40year low of 144.70 yenwas linked to the markets perception that Washington wasunhappy with the rate of adjustment of world trade imbalancesand that a continued orderly dollar decline was the leastdisruptive way of accelerating the process.    While most analysts do not expect any marked change ofattitude in Washington, they were reluctant to open any freshpositions until later in the week.    We are reserving judgement for the time being, said DougMadison of Commerzbank Ag.    The tranquility of the dollar market spread to sterlingtrading today. The pound ended unchanged against the dollar at1.617585 and edged up to 2.957 marks from 2.955 yesterday.    However, underyling sentiment remains positive after a U.K.opinion poll gave the ruling Conservative party its highestpopularity rating since it was reelected in 1983.    Sterling still seems to be on the firm side, said onedealer.    The Canadian currency also retained a generally strongertone, rising to 1.305560 to its U.S. counterpart from1.308085 yesterday.    According to figures provided by Morgan Guaranty Trust Co,the dollars tradeweighted value at midday was 5.7 pct belowaverage market rates in 198082, compared with 5.5 pctyesterday."

Yeutter referred specifically to the problems ofagricultural trade, where subsidized exports have been a pointof contention most notably between the United States and theEuropean Community.    Think of the vast waste of financial and other resources,he said.    Yeutter said much of the problem underlying the disputewith Japan over semiconductors was due to overproduction.    The trade representative called for a longterm approach tointernational trade and said the recent commitment to afreetrade agreement between the United States and Canada was astep in the right direction.

Were still pushing for a fully invested position in U.S.stocks but we also recognize the market is up 40 pct sinceSeptember, says Burton Siegel, investment strategist.    Rein van der Does, director of international research,admits to being cautious and somewhat confused about certaindevelopments in the Tokyo market, such as Nippon Telephoneshares trading at 250 times earnings.    The firm recently dropped its recommendation on Jaguar plcJAGRY following a sharp runup in the shares. About the sametime, says analyst Khaled Abdel Majeed, Drexel issued a buyrecommendation on the West german automaker BMW.    He says a new plant and new models brighten the outlook for1987 and 1988. The company trades in Germany on the parentcompanys earnings but on worldwide consolidated earnings, themultiple is seven or eight, half that of competitors.    By contrast Jaguars share price to earnings multiple isabout 12 and DaimlerBenz AG is around 14 or 15.    Drexel analyst Lucille Palermo recently upgradedrecommendations on some Canadian gold stocks. With no recessionin sight she sees improved physical demand plus new buyinginterest from the Middle East. Also, expectation of a higherinflation rate stimulates demand.    On the supply side she thinks people are overlooking theproblems in South Africa.  Palermo says all of this will pushthe bullion price to 475 dlrs an ounce by the end of the year.    Her current buy recommendations are AgnicoEagle Mines LtdAEAGF, American Barrick Resources Corp ABX, and Echo BayMines Ltd ECO.    Palermo also believes the overall Canadian stock market hasgreater potential this year than last. Although the Canadiandollar has moved up slightly it is below levels of severalyears ago. Canadian exports of all types look relatively cheapto foreigners  resources, manufactured goods, bonds andstocks.    Other European stocks favored by Drexel include ClubMediterranee CMI, PernodRicard, Royal Dutch Petroleum RD,Unilever UN, British Petroleum Co plc BP and ImperialChemical Industries plc ICI.

Crude oil, gasoline and heating oil all posted gains on theNew York Mercantile Exchange, with crude oil prices matchinglifeofcontract highs. Crude for delivery in May closed 17cents higher at 18.84 dlrs a barrel.    Crude futures could jump above 19 dlrs a barrel but willnot remain there long if products are not strong, RobertMurphy, account executive at E.F. Hutton, said.    Traders said prices were supported by anticipation that theAmerican Petroleum Institute would report a decline in domesticinventories of petroleum products in a weekly report.    Traders said prices also were supported by an escalation inthe IranIraq war, with the Iranians reportedly launching a newoffensive against Iraqi positions, and Iraq attacking offshoreoil fields and an oil export depot.    Buying by speculators continued to prompt gains in gold andsilver futures on the Commodity Exchange in New York.    Gold prices retreated at midday, but rallied before theclose with support from the silver market, which wasapproaching twoyear highs, traders said.    Soybean futures posted strong gains on the Chicago Board ofTrade, while corn and wheat were mostly higher.    Traders said cash sales have been slow in the country, andthe soybean harvest in Brazil has been delayed by rain, whichis limiting supplies.    In addition, the Agriculture Department last week projecteda substantial drop in soybean acreage this year.     Mondaysreport that the USDA inspected 46 mln bushels of corn forexport last week was unexpectedly high and, coupled with a lackof farm sales, provided support for the corn market, traderssaid.    Live hogs and frozen pork bellies rallied on the ChicagoMercantile Exchange, while cattle ended lower.    Live hogs pushed ahead on a lack of supplies because manyfarmers are turning their attention to spring planting ratherthan marketing livestock, traders said, noting that cash saleshave been lighter than expected this week.    The lack of marketing also has supported pork bellies, butprices drifted lower for moderate losses in nearby months asspeculators sold contracts to take profits, traders said.    Cattle prices closed lower but continued to show strengthrelated to tight supplies.    Prices pushed ahead to new contract highs, extending gainspast threeyear peaks set Monday, as tight supplies forced meatpackers to bid aggressively for available animals.    However, some traders sold contracts to take profits afterthe extended rally, which has seen the April delivery contractsoar to 69.90 cents a pound from 56 cents a pound at the startof the year.    New York coffee futures closed higher on trade talk Brazilwould not be an aggressive seller near term, analysts said."

Arbitrage buyprograms were triggered when the June S and P reached a 3.20point premium over the spot index, traders said.    However, weakness in the bond market in afternoon tradesparked selling in June S and Ps, sending the nearby contractto a discount which triggered the unwinding of buy programs,traders said.

  "title": "U.S. CREDIT MARKETS CLOSE SHARPLY LOWER",
  "body": "Firm oil prices, a sharp stock pricefall and widespread fear that the dollar has much more room todecline sent bond prices tumbling, dealers said.    The key 712 pct Treasury bonds of 2016 fell 1332 pointsto close at 95132 and a 7.94 pct yield that was up 10 basispoints from Monday and was 1987s highest closing yield.    Investors threw in the towel today. The long bond seemsheaded for eight pct within the next few days, a trader said.That would correspond to a price of about 9438.    Treasury bill rates increased two to eight basis points.Notes prices declined 18 to 34.    Bond traders said the main negative is recent instabilityof the dollar and growing feeling that even concerted centralbank support will not be able to prevent a further sharpdecline in the U.S. currency.    The dollar came under mild downward pressure early andfinished with modest net losses. The currency was largelyunaffected by generally supportive comments by Federal ReserveChairman Paul Volcker and Japanese Finance Minister KiichiMiyazawa.    Miyazawa once again said he and Treasury Secretary JamesBaker agree on the need for stable foreign exchange rates.    Fed Chairman Paul Volcker told Congress that the dollarsfall thus far should be large enough, in a context of agrowing world economy and fiscal restraint in the U.S., tosupport widespread expectations of a narrowing in the realtrade deficit in the period ahead.    Despite favorable comments by Volcker and Miyazawa, thereappears to be broad agreement among currency and bond marketparticipants that a huge Federal budget deficit and a wide,although narrowing, trade gap will further depress the dollar.That could mean Japanese and other foreign investors will buyfewer U.S. bonds or even start selling them.    There has been no evidence of largescale sales of U.S.bonds by the Japanese. Some dealers said that these investorsactually purchased a modest amount of U.S. debt today, but theyfocused on shorter maturities in the twoyear area rather thanon long bonds.    To the extent that overseas investors back away from theU.S. bond market, dealers said that higher yields will beneeded to lure others to take their place.    A late Federal funds rate rise contributed slightly to thebond market retreat. After averaging 6.20 pct yesterday, fundsopened at 618 pct and traded between 6116 and 614 pct.    The Federal funds rate rise occurred despite the Fedsunexpected direct supply of temporary reserves. The Fedarranged twoday System repurchase agreements with fundstrading at 618 pct.    Treasury bill rates increased largely in response to thehigher funds rate. Rates on new three and sixmonth bills rosetwo and seven basis points from Mondays auction averages toclose at 5.5554 pct and 5.7069 pct. Year bills at 5.8180 pctwere up eight basis points from yesterdays close.    Among notes, the 638s of 1989 dropped 18 to 99916,with the 714s of 1996 down 34 at 9738."

  "title": "DOLLAR ENDS WITH MODEST LOSSES IN NEW YORK",
  "body": "The dollar ended with modest net lossesagainst most major currencies as the market conducted a finalround of positionsquaring ahead of tomorrows crucial Group ofFive and Group of Seven meetings, dealers said.    The dollar was trendless today. People are waiting to seeif anything new comes from the meetings tomorrow and will thentake it from there, said one dealer at a top European bank.    As a result, generally supportive comments by FederalReserve Chairman Paul Volcker and Japanese Finance MinisterKiichi Miyazawa went largely unheeded.    The dollar closed at 145.6070 yen, down from 145.8590.    However, the dollars yen closing level was comfortablyabove its overseas low of just under 145 yen. Against the mark,the dollar finished at 1.827080 marks after falling to 1.8180in Europe and ending at 1.826070 here yesterday.    In Congressional testimony this morning, Fed Chairman PaulVolcker harped on his longheld fears about the potentiallycatastrophic fallout from a sharp dollar decline.    He also said the dollars fall, thus far, should be largeenough, in a context of a growing world economy and fiscalrestraint in the U.S., to support widespread expectations of anarrowing in the real trade deficit in the period ahead.    The market impact of Volckers comments was minimal. Itwas the same old story. Volcker was just fulfilling his role asa defender of the currency, said one trader.    The market was similarly dismissive of Japanese FinanceMinister Kiichi Miyazawas upbeat appraisal of his hourlongconversation with U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker thisafternoon.    Miyazawa said that they both agreed on the need forcurrency stabilization and that he was satisfied with the rolethe U.S. has played in coordinated international efforts toprop up the dollar since the late February Paris agreement.    Miyazawa can talk until hes blue in the face. The onlyperson who will make a difference is Baker, said Alan Rose ofFirst Interstate Bank in Los Angeles.    The key question for the currency market is whether theReagan administration will have a change of view to thedollar. If not, the dollar is going lower, he added.    The dollars recent tumble to a 40year low of 144.70 yenwas linked to the markets perception that Washington wasunhappy with the rate of adjustment of world trade imbalancesand that a continued orderly dollar decline was the leastdisruptive way of accelerating the process.    While most analysts do not expect any marked change ofattitude in Washington, they were reluctant to open any freshpositions until later in the week.    We are reserving judgement for the time being, said DougMadison of Commerzbank Ag.    The tranquility of the dollar market spread to sterlingtrading today. The pound ended unchanged against the dollar at1.617585 and edged up to 2.957 marks from 2.955 yesterday.    However, underlying sentiment remains positive after a U.K.opinion poll gave the ruling Conservative party its highestpopularity rating since it was reelected in 1983.    Sterling still seems to be on the firm side, said onedealer.    The Canadian currency also retained a generally strongertone, rising to 1.305560 to its U.S. counterpart from1.308085 yesterday.    According to figures provided by Morgan Guaranty Trust Co,the dollars tradeweighted value at midday was 5.7 pct belowaverage market rates in 198082, compared with 5.5 pctyesterday."

At a meeting of the NortheastMidwest Coalition, anorganization of U.S. legislators, David Cooke, chairman of theOntario Parliaments Select Committee on Economic Affairs, saidthe exemption would help trade relations.    The trade legislation to be considered by the full House inlate April would require President Reagan to retaliate againstforeign unfair trade practices unless the trade actions wouldharm the U.S. economy.    Currently, Reagan can reject trade sanctions on anygrounds.    Cooke, a member of the Liberal party, told the U.S.congressmen, I can understand the trade bill. I think it hasto do with concerns you have with the other parts of the world.    I would suggest to you that we are your best friends. Youdo not have those concerns with Canada and you should sincerelyconsider exempting our country from that bill, he added.

  "title": "TEXAS MAY CONSIDER INCOME TAX TO SOLVE BUDGET WOES",
  "body": "The State of Texas, faced with a record5.8 billion dlr budget deficit over the next two years, mayhave to consider introducing income tax,economic analysts said.     Such a possibility was unthinkable a few years back whenthe states enormous wealth from oil and gas revenues easilyallowed Texans the luxury of paying no personal or corporateincome tax.     However, last years dramatic slump in oil prices not onlysent the Texas economy into a tailspin, but cut heavily intothe states tax revenues.    Both Moodys Investor Services and Standard and Poors cuttheir credit ratings of the state to double A from the toptriple A in early March.    Moodys Vice President George W. Leung said it was thefirst time Texas rating had been lowered since 1962, addingthe report noted that while the Legislature is now consideringproposals to restore budget balance, medium term prospects forfull recovery are weak.    With only a slight improvement in the economy seen by StateComptroller Bob Bullock, the Texas Legislature must grapplewith a one billion dlr deficit by August 31 and another 4.8billion dlr deficit by the end of the next biennium. No otherstate in U.S. history has faced such a deficit.    There is a strong independent streak in Texans and fiveyears ago I would never have dreamed the State Legislaturewould institute an income tax, said George Bland, AssistantProfessor of Political Science at North Texas State University,adding, Now my contacts at the Legislature tell me itscoming, its inevitable, its only a matter of time.     State taxes on oil and gas production traditionallysupplied as much as a third of the states revenues.    However, that source has fallen to about 15 pct in recentyears, and with last years price slump, the states dependenceon sales taxes is approaching 50 pct.     Bland said he believes the Tax Reform Act will be a majorfactor in the states decision because under it sales taxes areno longer deductible from federal income tax while state incometax is.    John Kennedy, senior research associate at the AustinbasedTexas Research League said, There is a great deal of popularsentiment against it, plus the first plank of GovernorClements platform was no tax increases, let alone a new tax.    However, he said that since the oil price fall the statefaced a choice of either instituting an income tax orbroadening and possibly raising the sales tax.    Steve Pejovich, director of the Center for Free Enterpriseat Texas A and M University and an opponent of income taxes,said he favored reforming the present tax system to takeaccount of the changed structure of the economy.    We should rely less on traditional sources, such as oiland agriculture and real estate and more on service industries,manufacturing and hightech, Pejovich said.    Tony Proffitt, an aide to State Comptroller Bob Bullocksaid, Bullock is opposed to an income tax, but has warned theLegislature that if they get tired of looking at everythingelse, thats the only option.    Apart from Texas, states which have no individual incometax are Alaska, Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire, South Dakota,Washington and Wyoming     For the time being, Attorney General Jim Mattox has ruledthat the Legislature may carry over the current one billion dlrdeficit into the next biennium, even though the stateconsitution requires a balanced budget. But as State TreasurerAnn Richards said last Thursday, Jim Mattoxs decision todayturns the heat down on the pressure cooker, but we must notthink that the goose isnt still cooking.    Opponents to new or higher taxes argue in favor of spendingcuts. But the state is already under pressure from a FederalDistrict Court to clean up its overcrowded prison system  orface 24 mln dlrs a month in fines.    And U.S. Education Secretary William Bennett has accusedthe state, among others, of lax education reform. Earlier thisyear, both houses of the Legislature, citing financialrestraints as well as teacher morale, passed bills abandoningplans to require teachers to take competency tests.    Bland said he believes the state will set up a commissionnext year to study alternative revenue sources, with anincome tax being instituted as early as January 1989.    If the political leaders are educated about the effectsof the Tax Reform Act, I think there will be a gradual drifttoward income tax, he said."

It would force us to break the bank, throw out theABM treaty and commit us to an arms race in space.    The Reagan administration is engaged in an internal debateover the Strategic Defense Initiative SDI, as the land andspacebased antimissile system is called, and may decide laterthis month to reinterpret the 1972 AntiBallistic Missiletreaty to justify an acceleration of SDI research to includedevelopment and space testing.    Johnston, of Louisiana, and fellow Democrat WilliamProxmire of Wisconsin, whose staff prepared the report, accusedthe administration of covertly seeking early  deployment as apolitical ploy to commit the United States to strategicdefenses even after Reagan leaves office in 1989.    This report exposes the fact that without a presidentialdirective or congressional consent, the SDI program ... isbeing changed to pursue a nearterm deployment of strategicdefenses, Proxmire, chairman of the powerful SenateAppropriations Defense Subcommittee, said.

The IMF and the Bank may be less inclined to put togetherlarge packages like Mexico, Ruding told reporters in a briefingon this weeks semiannual IMF and World Bank talks.    Ruding, who is also chairman of the IMFs policymakingInterim Committee, said he was reflecting a feeling within thetwo institutions.    Asked whether his comments reflected a feeling theinstitutions were being unduly pressured by the Reaganadministration, Ruding replied we should not go in thedirection of politicisation of the two institutions.    Ruding said no country large or small should push in thatdirection.  He said he expected commercial bank lending todebtors to come in for some criticism for the slow pace oflending recently. Ruding also said he did not expect any majorinitiatives to develop a larger commercial bank role in thedebt strategy or any new proposals for dealing with the debtcrisis itself.    In other remarks, Ruding said many countries supported aGeneral Capital Increase for the World Bank and he expectedBank president Barber Conable also to express his support.    The U.S. has said it is opposed to a GCI at present.    Ruding said the Interim Committee Communique would supportthe use of indicators to assist multilateral surveillance butwould stop short of supporting U.S. proposals for automaticconsultations if indicators were sharply out of line withpolicy objectives. Monetary sources say the U.S. has suggestedestablishing norms or automatic triggers for consultationsamong industrial states if policies deviate from plan.    Currently the plan also has the support of France, theNetherlands and Italy while Britain, Japan and West Germany areall opposed."

  "title": "CURRENCY FUTURES TO KEY OFF G5, G7 MEETINGS",
  "body": "News of an agreement among G5 and G7finance ministers meeting in Washington this week will be keyto the direction of currency futures at the InternationalMonetary Market, but any such agreement will need to go beyondthe Paris accord to stem the recent rise in futures, financialanalysts said.    If they the finance ministers give the market somethingreally new to look at  that is, some package that goes beyondthe Paris agreement  you could have a real boost in thedollar, said Shearson Lehman Brothers analyst Anne Mills.    On the other hand, anything neutral would tend to bebearish for the dollar, Mills said.    Traders and analysts agree a simple reaffirmation of theParis accord will not be enough to halt the decline in thedollar, nor will central bank intervention.    A lot of people are looking for a reason to buy currenciesand sell the dollar, said one trader for a large retail firmon the floor of the IMM.    If there is no concrete resolution, they will be lookingto sell the dollar, possibly down to the 1.80 mark level, hesaid.    Technically, most currency futures are poised for anotherrise, said Smith Barney Harris Upham analyst Craig Sloane.    Sloane noted that June yen futures set a new contract highon Tuesday and closed at its best level ever, while Junesterling set a new contract high on Monday.    Everything seems to be coming to a head right now and youdont need much to get things rolling, Sloane said.    In particular, the June Canadian dollar, for which Sloanerecently put out a buy recommendation, has hovered in a rangebetween 0.7600 and 0.7660 in recent weeks, forming a triangleon the charts from which it may soon break out on the upside.    A close above the contract high of 0.7665 would signal abreakout, Sloane said, and would likely mean the nearbyCanadian dollar contract would extend its advance to near the0.7800 level. June Canadian dollar closed at 0.7656 Tuesday.    Mills noted, however, that interest rate differentialsbetween Canadian securities and U.S. securities have narroweddramatically recently, with yields on 10year Canadian bondsonly about 80 basis points above U.S. 10year notes.    What has helped the Canadian currency, she noted, is anincreasing proportion of foreign funds flowing into theCanadian equity market, particularly from Japanese investors.    Other analysts, however, said currency futures may be nearthe top of their longterm rally.    Something will be done at the G5 and G7 meeting tocalm people, said David Horner of Merrill Lynch Economics.    The Paris accord has pretty much fixed where major Europeancurrencies will trade, Horner said.    But sterling futures may still make another run for newhighs, up to 1.6300 to 1.6500 dlr in the June contract, on thepositive atmosphere that will prevail before British electionsand possibly another interest rate cut, Horner said. The JuneBritish pound closed at 1.6080 on Tuesday.    Horner said that new boundaries for the trading range ofthe yen are likely to come out of the G5 and G7 meetings.    The most likely range will be a bottom for the dollarbetween 140 to 142 yen per dollar and a top near 150 to 152yen, Horner said. In yen futures, the bottom of the dollarsrange would be equivalent to 0.007100 to 0.007150 in the Junecontract. June yen closed at 0.006913 on Tuesday.    If such a range does emerge from the meetings, we willhave one more rally in the yen, Horner said."

  "body": "Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehlsaid a weaker dollar would be risky and a further appreciationof the mark would damage prospects for sustained West Germaneconomic growth.    In a speech to the Institute of Contempory German Affairshere, Poehl said It would be an extremely risky policy to aimfor a further substantial decline in the value of the dollar tocorrect the trade deficit.    He said the United States could face a vicious circle ofdepreciation, inflation and more depreciation if it took thatroute.    Poehl noted West Germany had already taken steps to meetU.S. Demands for greater stimulation of its domestic economy,accelerating tax cuts, cutting interest rates and toleratingabovetarget money supply growth.    He said he would have been happy to have brought forwardfive billion marks of tax cuts now planned for January 1988 tothe beginning of this year, but he said the government facedpolitical constraints getting such measures through the upperhouse of the West German parliament.    But there were also limits to the impact West Germany couldaccept on exports from a rising mark, he said.    Poehl said West Germany relied on exports for aboutonethird of its gross national product, so a substantialerosion of export markets could not be offset by increasingdemand at home.    A further appreciation of the mark could even be anobstacle to further growth, he said.    Poehl said the Bundesbank had tolerated rapid money supplygrowth last year because the country enjoyed low inflation andbecause external factors, including low oil prices andfavourable terms of trade, had given some extra leeway.    But Poehl said West Germany now faced a difficult dilemmaover monetary policy.    The underlying rate of inflation was now two pct, not thereported negative inflation rates last year, and West Germanywas affected more than before by exchange rate developments.    For the time being, we will have to focus our policy moreon the external side, and we can live with a more expansionarymoney supply. But we must be very careful, he said.    He said he shared some of the U.S. Concern about Japanstrade surpluses, which affected European countries as well asthe United States.    Poehl welcomed the socalled Louvre accord of monetaryofficials of major industrialized countries, saying theimportance of the February 22 agreement to stabilize exchangerates had been underestimated.    All partners had agreed that the dollar was at about theright level, and that further changes would damage growth, hesaid.    This was a remarkable change in attitude, especially on thepart of our American colleagues, he said.    But he said there was still a danger that the correction ofthe dollars value could overshoot.

The law, proposed by Prime Minister Branko Mikulic, goesinto effect on July 1 and aims to end a longstanding practiceof supporting unprofitable companies. Under the law, wage cutswill be imposed on losing enterprises, while those failing torecover within a sixmonth grace period will face liquidation.    The diplomats said Mikulics attempt to create a marketeconomy is inevitable, but has still come as a shock to thoseaccustomed to government subsidies.    It was a bitter pill which had to be swallowed, but if anoverdose is taken too abruptly, it may have adverse effects onthe system, a Western diplomat said.    He said if the law was applied too strictly it wouldprobably provoke a new wave of strikes and unrest.    Yugoslavia was swept by strikes last month following theintroduction of a wagefreeze law, later amended to allow moreflexibility and some exemptions in what some political analystssaw as a retreat by Mikulic.    But with inflation moving towards 100 pct, trade unionleaders have asked how much more deprivation workers can take.    The union leaders said workers thoughout the country arealready receiving salaries below limits set under existing law,while others have received no wages at all this year becausetheir employers are unable to pay them.    Workers also complain much of their income is taken inlocal, state and federal taxes.    Many others are losing their motivation to work andconfidence in government as they feel their decisionmakingpowers are being eroded, trade union officials said.    Meanwhile, the official Tanjug news agency reported a paperand cellulose factory at Ivangrad in the Montenegro republicclosed yesterday and 2,000 of its workers were given temporaryleave.

  "body": "Mounting trade friction between theU.S. And Japan has raised fears among many of Asias exportingnations that the row could inflict farreaching economicdamage, businessmen and officials said.    They told Reuter correspondents in Asian capitals a U.S.Move against Japan might boost protectionist sentiment in theU.S. And lead to curbs on American imports of their products.    But some exporters said that while the conflict would hurtthem in the longrun, in the shortterm Tokyos loss might betheir gain.    The U.S. Has said it will impose 300 mln dlrs of tariffs onimports of Japanese electronics goods on April 17, inretaliation for Japans alleged failure to stick to a pact notto sell semiconductors on world markets at below cost.    Unofficial Japanese estimates put the impact of the tariffsat 10 billion dlrs and spokesmen for major electronics firmssaid they would virtually halt exports of products hit by thenew taxes.    We wouldnt be able to do business, said a spokesman forleading Japanese electronics firm Matsushita ElectricIndustrial Co Ltd MC.T.    If the tariffs remain in place for any length of timebeyond a few months it will mean the complete erosion ofexports of goods subject to tariffs to the U.S., said TomMurtha, a stock analyst at the Tokyo office of broker JamesCapel and Co.    In Taiwan, businessmen and officials are also worried.    We are aware of the seriousness of the U.S. Threat againstJapan because it serves as a warning to us, said a seniorTaiwanese trade official who asked not to be named.    Taiwan had a trade trade surplus of 15.6 billion dlrs lastyear, 95 pct of it with the U.S.    The surplus helped swell Taiwans foreign exchange reservesto 53 billion dlrs, among the worlds largest.    We must quickly open our markets, remove trade barriers andcut import tariffs to allow imports of U.S. Products, if wewant to defuse problems from possible U.S. Retaliation, saidPaul Sheen, chairman of textile exporters Taiwan Safe Group.    A senior official of South Koreas trade promotionassociation said the trade dispute between the U.S. And Japanmight also lead to pressure on South Korea, whose chief exportsare similar to those of Japan.    Last year South Korea had a trade surplus of 7.1 billiondlrs with the U.S., Up from 4.9 billion dlrs in 1985.    In Malaysia, trade officers and businessmen said toughcurbs against Japan might allow hardhit producers ofsemiconductors in third countries to expand their sales to theU.S.    In Hong Kong, where newspapers have alleged Japan has beenselling belowcost semiconductors, some electronicsmanufacturers share that view. But other businessmen said sucha shortterm commercial advantage would be outweighed byfurther U.S. Pressure to block imports.    That is a very shortterm view, said Lawrence Mills,directorgeneral of the Federation of Hong Kong Industry.    If the whole purpose is to prevent imports, one day it willbe extended to other sources. Much more serious for Hong Kongis the disadvantage of action restraining trade, he said.    The U.S. Last year was Hong Kongs biggest export market,accounting for over 30 pct of domestically produced exports.    The Australian government is awaiting the outcome of tradetalks between the U.S. And Japan with interest and concern,Industry Minister John Button said in Canberra last Friday.    This kind of deterioration in trade relations between twocountries which are major trading partners of ours is a veryserious matter, Button said.    He said Australias concerns centred on coal and beef,Australias two largest exports to Japan and also significantU.S. Exports to that country.    Meanwhile U.S.Japanese diplomatic manoeuvres to solve thetrade standoff continue.    Japans ruling Liberal Democratic Party yesterday outlineda package of economic measures to boost the Japanese economy.    The measures proposed include a large supplementary budgetand record public works spending in the first half of thefinancial year.    They also call for steppedup spending as an emergencymeasure to stimulate the economy despite Prime MinisterYasuhiro Nakasones avowed fiscal reform program.    Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Michael Smith and MakotoKuroda, Japans deputy minister of International Trade andIndustry MITI, are due to meet in Washington this week in aneffort to end the dispute.

But he said the question was stillbeing considered by Trade Minister Rachmat Saleh and nodecision on when to go ahead had been made.

Several factors make us move cautiously, Nainggolan said.We want to move slowly and safely so that we do not make amistake and undermine confidence in the exchange.

  "title": "SUMITOMO BANK AIMS AT QUICK RECOVERY FROM MERGER",
  "body": "Sumitomo Bank Ltd SUMI.T is certain tolose its status as Japans most profitable bank as a result ofits merger with the Heiwa Sogo Bank, financial analysts said.    Osakabased Sumitomo, with desposits of around 23.9trillion yen, merged with Heiwa Sogo, a small, struggling bankwith an estimated 1.29 billion dlrs in unrecoverable loans, inOctober.    But despite the linkup, Sumitomo President Koh Komatsutold Reuters he is confident his bank can quickly regain itsposition.    Well be back in position in first place within threeyears, Komatsu said in an interview.    He said that while the merger will initially reduceSumitomos profitability and efficiency, it will vastly expandSumitomos branch network in the Tokyo metropolitan area whereit has been relatively weak.    But financial analysts are divided on whether and howquickly the gamble will pay off.    Some said Sumitomo may have paid too much for Heiwa Sogo inview of the smaller banks large debts. Others argue the mergerwas more cost effective than creating a comparable branchnetwork from scratch.    The analysts agreed the bank was aggressive. It hasexpanded overseas, entered the lucrative securities businessand geared up for domestic competition, but they questioned thewisdom of some of those moves.    Theyve made bold moves to put everything in place. Nowits largely out of their hands, said Kleinwort Benson Ltdfinancial analyst Simon Smithson.    Among Sumitomos problems are limits placed on its move toenter U.S. Securities business by taking a share in Americaninvestment bank Goldman, Sachs and Co.    Sumitomo last August agreed to pay 500 mln dlrs for a 12.5pct limited partnership in the bank, but for the time being atleast, the Federal Reserve Board has forbidden them to exchangepersonnel, or increase the business they do with each other.    The tieup is widely looked on as a lame duck because theFed was stricter than Sumitomo expected, said one analyst.    But Komatsu said the move will pay off in time.    U.S. Regulations will change in the near future and if so,we can do various things. We only have to wait two or threeyears, not until the 21st century, Komatsu said.    Komatsu is also willing to be patient about possible routesinto the securities business at home.    Article 65 of the Securities and Exchange Act, Japansversion of the U.S. GlassSteagall Act, separates commercialfrom investment banking.    But the walls between the two are crumbling and Komatsusaid he hopes further deregulation will create newopportunities.    We need to find new business chances, Komatsu said. In somecases these will be securities related, in some cases trustbank related. Thats the kind of deregulation we want.    Until such changes occur, Sumitomo will focus on suchdomestic securities business as profitable government bonddealing and strengthening relations with Meiko Securities CoLtd, in which it holds a five pct share, Komatsu said.    He said Sumitomo is cautiously optimistic about enteringthe securities business here through its Swiss universal banksubsidiary, Banca del Gottardo.     The Finance Ministry is expected to grant licences tosecurities subsidiaries of U.S. Commercial banks soon,following a similar decision for subsidiaries of Europeanuniversal banks in which the parent holds a less than 50 pct.    But Komatsu is reluctant to push hard for a similardecision on a Gottardo subsidiary.    We dont want to make waves. We expect this will be allowedin two or three years, he said.    Like other city banks, Sumitomo is also pushing to expandlending to individuals and small and medium businesses toreplace disappearing demand from big business, he added.    The analysts said Sumitomo will have to devote a lot oftime to digesting its most recent initiatives, including themerger with ailing Heiwa Sogo.    Its Sumitomo been bold in its strategies, saidKleinworts Smithson.    After that, its a question of absorbing and jugglingaround. It will be the next decade before we see if thestrategy is right or wrong. REUTER3"

A Bundesbank spokesman said in answer to enquiries that thewithdrawal of funds did not reflect a tightening of creditpolicy, but was to be seen in the context of plentifulliquidity in the banking system.    Banks held an average 59.3 billion marks at the Bundesbankover the first six days of the month, well clear of the likelyApril minimum reserve requirement of 51 billion marks.    The Bundesbank spokesman noted that by bidding only 12.2billion marks, below the outgoing 14.9 billion, banksthemselves had shown they felt they had plenty of liquidity.

  "title": "ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT  EXCESS MONEY HURTS THAI BANKS",
  "body": "Thailands improving economy may havehelped its trade and finance position but it has also createdmajor problems for local banks, Thai and foreign bankers said.    They said a 900 mln dlr saving from cheaper imported oiland 19.7 pct export growth last year contributed to thecountrys first current account surplus in 20 years.    But the bright picture, together with a government programto help farmers cope with depressed commodity prices, coincideswith sluggish investment by a private sector still feeling thelingering effects of the 198486 recession.    Thai banks have had growing surplus funds and difficultiesfinding borrowers since the third quarter of 1986.    Kunthon Narkprom, head of the budget and planning divisionof Thai Farmers Bank Ltd, estimated excess liquidity in bankspeaked last month at 60 billion baht, three times what heconsidered normal. Bank of Thailand figures show total depositsin 1986 grew 12.7 pct to 627.7 billion baht, while lending roseonly 3.4 pct to 548.6 billion.    The lendingdeposit ratio, which measures bank loans as apercentage of deposits, fell to 86.6 pct last month, the lowestsince the 1970s, after averaging 96.6 pct in 1985.    Thai banks have cut lending and deposit rates a record sixtimes since January 1986, during which time the average minimumloan rate fell to 11.5 pct from 15.5 and the gross oneyearfixed deposit rate to 7.25 pct from 11.    Five banks announced last week they would cut their maximumlending rates to small borrowers by one percentage point to 14pct.    Kunthon of Thai Farmers estimated banks now have a combined80 billion baht unused overdraft line as many small andmediumsize companies delay borrowing in anticipation of morecuts in interest rates.    The record liquidity has seriously hurt the profits ofbanks, which have been forced to invest idle funds in lowyieldgovernment securities.    Kunthon said the banks hold four to 10 billion baht inshortterm government bonds bought through the Bank ofThailands bond repurchase facility, double the normal amount.    Thailands 16 local commercial banks registered one oftheir worst years in 1986, with overall profits falling over 30pct after a 14 pct decline in 1985.    Kunthon said profits should increase 10 pct this year asthe banks adjust to the new interest rate structure.    Olarn Chaipravat, senior executive vice president of SiamCommercial Bank Ltd, told reporters last week the liquidityproblem stems partly from the fact most loan demands come frombusinesses seeking funds for small, labourintensive projects.    He said there are few large, capitalintensive projects andmany borrowers go offshore to meet their requirements.    Somboon Chinsavananond, Thai Farmers fund managementexecutive, said liquidity has been aggravated by the centralbanks policy of fixing a stable bahtdollar exchange ratewhich permits Thai companies to import dollardenominated fundswith a minimal risk of currency exchange losses.    He said underlying bearishness towards the U.S. Dollar hasencouraged foreign borrowers who hope to pay less on loanprincipal when their loans mature.    Thai bankers said central bank governor Kamchorn Sathirakullast month rejected a request to increase a 10 pct withholdingtax on interest on foreign loans, a measure they said wouldreduce foreign borrowings. The governor replied the bankersshould extend more loans to rural areas instead.    Bankers said some Thai banks have offered creditworthyclients loans at near money market rates of seven to eight pctin a bid to compete with foreign funds.    A market analyst at Siam Commercial Bank said bank lendingat such rates amount to about 15 pct of all loans extended bythe industry.    A foreign banker, who requested anonymity, said thesegmented market approach used by Thai banks for settingdifferent lending rates has caused dislocation of funds in thefinancial sector, eroded bank profits and prevented banks fromtaking a more logical move of further cutting interest rates.    He said the liquidity problem gives the Bank of Thailand aperfect opportunity to assert more control on the Thai moneymarket.    The Bank of Thailand is taking a step in the rightdirection by planning to float three billion baht in bonds tomop up part of the surplus, he said, but he added the bank hasbeen lax in using its bond repurchase window as a tool toabsorb or inject liquidity into the market.    William Wu, head of the Treasury Unit of Chase ManhattanBank N.A., Said the money market lacks the instruments toabsorb liquidity and avoid sharp interest rate fluctuations.    He said the liquidity has fuelled the stock marketsstrongest rally in seven years and Thailand should seize theopportunity to develop the corporate bond market. REUTER3"

Two companies are ready to market such cars soon, theysaid. Honda Motor Co Ltd will sell its Prelude with fourwheelsteering from this Friday, and Mazda Motor Corp officials say amodel with the new steering will be out by midyear. Mazda aimsto ship the cars overseas before yearend but the decision willdepend on initial consumer reaction.    Nissan Motor Co Ltd has offered a less sophisticatedfourwheel steering system on its Skyline since August 1985.Toyota Motor Corp has exhibited its developments in the fieldat a recent motor show and Mitsubishi Motors Corp said it willuse the system in the near future.    Though major U.S. And European automakers have alsoresearched and tested the fourwheel system, they say they arewaiting to see consumer response to the Japanese cars and forfurther improvements in safety and costs.    Fourwheel steering allows drivers to easily manoeuvre intoparking spaces and gives more control on sharp turns.     Mazda officials believe the new steering will improvesafety. At extremes, fourwheel steering gives a driver morecontrol, said one official. On slippery surfaces or at highspeeds, the system reduces unnecessary movement of the vehicle.    While acknowledging the added vehicle stability, a Hondaengineer said This invention is not intended to improvesafety, but is aimed at allowing everyone to drive easily.    Mazdas electronic steering system tells the back wheels toturn in the opposite direction from the front wheels at slowspeeds but in the same direction at high speeds.    Hondas system, which is mechanical, is similar but thedirection of the rear wheels is determined by the angle of thefront wheels. With Nissans system the rear wheels move onlyparallel to the front.    Automakers say professional drivers who have tested thefourwheel steering say it greatly improves handling.    An official with one U.S. Vehicle manufacturer saidfourwheel steering is a technical improvement, but it isuncertain whether it will translate into higher sales orprofits. All automakers are interested in something new, hesaid. If it becomes a predominant factor, everyone will want tofollow.    The official said fourwheel steering is partly a gimmickto sell cars. Its a benefit of a secondary nature comparedwith devices for fuel economy or emission control.    General Motors Corp has developed a fourwheel steeringsystem, but is unlikely to market it within the next fiveyears, Y. Hojoh, engineer with the Japan branch of GeneralMotors Overseas Corp, said. GM must consider the costs to theconsumer, he added.    The industry sources said the additional cost of the systemin Japan would probably make little difference to the consumeras it would be added to already highpriced models. REUTER3"

  "body": "Japans Agriculture Ministry, angered byU.S. Demands that Japan open its farm products market, willtell U.S. Officials at talks later this month thatliberalisation would harm existing U.S. Farm exports to Japan,a senior ministry official said.    Imports from the U.S. Would drop due to active sales drivesby other suppliers, the official, who declined to be named,said. Japan is the largest customer for U.S. Farm products andit is not reasonable for the U.S. To demand Japan liberaliseits farm import market, he said.    Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato has said if the U.S.Insists Japan open its protected rice market it will also openits wheat market, where volume and origin are regulated toprotect local farmers.    Australia and Canada could then increase their wheatexports as they are more competitive than the U.S., He said.Endusers would also buy other origins, grain traders said.    U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who is due tovisit Japan for talks between April 1627, has said he will askJapan to offer a share of its rice market to U.S. Suppliers andremove quotas on U.S. Beef and citrus imports.    Other countries are already cutting into the U.S. Marketshare here. Australia, the largest beef supplier to Japan, hasbeen trying to boost exports prior to the expiry of a fouryearbeef accord next March 31.    Imports of U.S. Corn have fallen due to increased salesfrom China and South America, while Japanese soybean importsfrom Brazil are expected to rise sharply this year, althoughthe U.S. Will remain the largest supplier.    U.S. Feedgrain sales will also drop if Japan opens up itsbeef imports, since Japan depends almost entirely on feedgrainimports, mainly from the U.S., Japanese officials said.    An indication of the U.S. Position came last December whenUnder Secretary of Agriculture Daniel Amstutz said Japan hasthe potential to provide one of the largest boosts to U.S.Agricultural exports, with the beef market alone representingsome one billion dlrs in new business.    The U.S. Has also asked the General Agreement on Tariffsand Trade to investigate the legality of Japanese importcontrols on 12 other farm products, including fruit juices,purees and pulp, tomato juice, ketchup and sauce, peanuts,prepared beef products and miscellaneous beans.    To help calm heated trade relations with the U.S., Japanstop business group Keidanren has urged the government to removeresidual import restrictions on agricultural products.    But Agriculture Minister Kato has ruled out any emotionalreaction, and the senior ministry official said the farm issueshould not become a scapegoat for trade pressure in theindustrial sector.    Japan is the largest buyer of U.S. Farm products, and theseissues should not be discussed on the same table, the officialsaid. REUTER3"

  "body": "South Koreas trade surplus is growing toofast and the government has started taking steps to slow itdown, Deputy Prime Minister Kim Mahnje said.    He told a press conference the government planned toincrease investment, speed up the opening of the local marketto foreign imports and gradually adjust its currency to holdthe surplus at a proper level.    But he said the government would not allow the won toappreciate too much in a short period of time. South Korea hasbeen under pressure from Washington to revalue the won.    The U.S. Wants South Korea to cut its trade surplus withthe U.S., Which rose to 7.4 billion dlrs in 1986 from 4.3billion dlrs in 1985.    Kim, who is also economic planning minister, said prospectswere bright for the South Korean economy, but the governmentwould try to hold the current account surplus to around fivebillion dlrs a year for the next five years.    Our government projections of eight pct GNP growth, fivebillion dlrs of current account surplus and 12 pct growth inexports all seemed to be reasonable early this year. But nowthe surplus is growing faster than we expected, he said.    Trade ministry officials said South Koreas exports rose 35pct to 9.34 billion dlrs in the first three months of thisyear, while imports rose only 8.5 pct to 8.2 billion dlrs.    Kim said the swing of South Koreas current account to asurplus of 4.65 billion dlrs in 1986 from an 890 mln dlrdeficit in 1985 was very significant. The surplus enabled thecountry to reduce its foreign debt last year for the firsttime.    South Koreas foreign debt, which fell to 44.5 billion dlrsin 1986 from 46.8 billion in 1985, is still among the largestin Asia.    This huge amount of our foreign debt has been one of themajor constraints on our development... Last year was a majorturning point for the Korean economy, Kim said.    Kim said his government plannned to reduce the ratio offoreign debt to the countrys GNP to about 20 pct in 1991, fromabout 50 pct in 1986.    The government, however, does not want to acceleratereducing the debt by making an excessive trade surplus, hesaid.    Kim said a sudden rise in the surplus would cause inflationand lead to trade friction with Seouls major trading partners,particularly the United States.    We need a surplus because we have to reduce our debt, butwe are taking measures to hold the size of the surplus at aproper level, Kim said. REUTER3"

  "body": "Finlands national oil company Neste OyNEOY.HE said in a statement it had agreed with Canadian firmsto study the feasibility of building a plant in Edmonton,Canada, to produce a replacement for lead in petrol.    The prospective plant would cost an estimated 270 mlnCanadian dlrs and would produce methyl tertiary butyl etherMTBE from raw materials available locally, it said.    The partners in the study are Neste Oy, Celanese CanadaInc, Hoechst Celanese Corporation and Trade Mountain Pipe LineCompany Ltd, of Vancouver, B.C.    The Edmonton site was suitable because of the raw materialsavailability, the proximity to pipeline transportation and theimportant capital and operating advantages gained by locatingon an existing Celanese Canada site, the statement said.    The partners would look into the feasibility of a plantproducing 500,000 tonnes per annum of MTBE, an octane enhancerthat can replace tetra ethyl lead.    Most of the MTBE would be targeted for the United Stateswhere lead levels in gasoline are being lowered because ofhealth concerns, the statement added.    Canadian lead limits are currently 11 times as high as theU.S. Limit but lead is scheduled for virtual elimination inCanada by 1993, which should create a Canadian demand for MTBE,it said.    Finlands Neste Oy, whose turnover last year was over fivebillion dlrs, has extensive experience with MTBE. It has amajor investment in an MTBE plant in Saudi Arabia.    The Edmonton, Alberta plant would be scheduled to go onstream in late 1989, the statement said. REUTER3"

  "body": "Talks betweenemployers and unions in the West German engineering industryover pay and working hours broke down without result late lastnight, an official from the IGMetall union said.    IGMetall, Western Europes largest union, is reviving itscampaign for a 35hour working week and is demanding a five pctpay increase. Strikes for a 35hour week in 1984 brought WestGermanys automobile industry virtually to a standstill.    The result of the 1984 campaign was a compromise reductionin working hours to 38.5 from 40.    The talks which broke down yesterday were in the key NorthWuerttembergNorth Baden area, which generally sets the trendfor the rest of the country.    IGMetall official Ernst Eisenmann, speaking last night,blamed the failure of the negotiations on the employers. Hesaid they had been uncompromising on the question of theshorter week.    HansPeter Stihl, negotiating for the employers, said anyplan to reduce working hours gradually to 35 hours wasunacceptable.     The employers have not made an official offer on cuttingthe working week, but sources involved in the negotiations saythat they are working on the basis of a possible halfhourreduction from next year and a pay increase of 2.7 pct in 1987and of 1.5 pct in 1988.    The Union will propose that the negotiations be officiallydeclared a failure and then a process of arbitration is likely.    IGMetall has said that cutting the working week willcreate jobs in West Germany where more than two mln people areunemployed. IGMetall itself has about 2.5 mln members.    IGMetall has already been staging a series of warningstrikes to press home demands for the 35hour week.    Yesterday, 23,000 engineering workers struck at 90 plantsfor one to two hours, according to an IGMetall statement.    Among the strikers were 4,000 at a DaimlerBenz AG DAIG.Fplant in Bremen, and 3,100 at Ford Motor Cos F FordWerke AGplant in Saarlouis. REUTER3"

The composite index hit a record 405.13 early last week,nearly 50 pct up from the New Year when it stood at 264.82, butplunged to a 383.48 close on April 3, the day after thegovernment intervened.    Under the measures, industrial firms with bank loans worth50 billion won or more must either offer new shares or issueconvertible bonds to repay the loans.    Securities houses will have to sell shares they are holdingif the volume exceeds 40 pct of their paidin capital. Theceiling for investment trust firms was fixed at 50 pct.    South Korean firms have traditionally preferred obtaininglow interest bank loans  the current rate is 10 pct  toissuing bonds at a higher rate or floating share issues withthe attendant dividend pressures and launch expenses.    The Seoul Stock Exchange, with 355 listed stocks, grewexplosively in the first three months of the year, building onan already impressive 68.9 pct gain in 1986.    Analysts now expect the market to pause temporarily andthen resume its upward movement, despite the indirectgovernment regulation.    They said the continuous growth of the nations grossnational product GNP and trade surplus, improved exports andgood performances by industrial firms all fuelled the boom.    The trade surplus widened to 460 mln dlrs in March from 110mln in February, while government economists expect GNP to grownine pct this year.    Analysts said the deep slump in the real estate market alsoincreased liquidity in the stock market.    Many investors are still confident the market will not loseits strength. It seems likely to pause for a while and thenrebound again, said Park Sinbom, a director of LuckySecurities Co.    There are more positive factors than negative. The marketis still buoyed by ample liquidity thanks to the economysstrong performance.    The stock market began to recover during Saturdayshalfday session with the index closing at 397.24 in activetrading on Monday, but closed lower on Tuesday at 390.24 onturnover of 76 billion won.

  "body": "The economic package unveiled yesterday bythe ruling Liberal Democratic Party LDP marks the start of amajor shift away from the policies of the past, privateeconomists and government officials said.    A big step forward has been taken, said Industrial Bank ofJapan Ltd senior economist Susumu Taketomi.    The package, seen as a response to mounting overseaspressure to boost the sagging Japanese economy, calls for asupplementary budget of more than 5,000 billion yen later thisyear, plus increased imports.    Although the measures must still gain the approval of theFinance Ministry, economists said the government will find ittoo difficult to alter the measures significantly once theyhave gained domestic and overseas backing.    At last, the LDP and the Ministry of Finance are turning acorner, said Sumitomo Bank Ltds chief economist MasahikoKoido.    For the past five years the government has adhered to atight fiscal policy in its drive to stop issuing deficitfinancing bonds in 1990.    To meet that goal, spending departments are required tosubmit annual budgets for current expenditure 10 pct below theprevious year and investment five pct below.    Masayoshi Ito, chairman of the LDPs policy affairscouncil, said yesterday the government must stick to its 1990fiscal reform target, but should review the ceiling it placeson public works spending.    Even some Finance Ministry officials privately acknowledgethat policy changes might be needed, including easing thegovernments iron grip on spending.    Economists said the government could meet its 1990 targetand also increase spending by using money it got from the saleof Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp shares and by takingadvantage of lower than expected interest rates on its debt.Officially, the Finance Ministry is adhering to its tightstance but some signs of change have appeared.    We do not have any intention of abandoning our objective torestore fiscal balance, a Finance Ministry spokesman said.    He said so far the ministry had tried to achieve two goalssimultaneously. These were reforming the governments fiscalposition and stimulating domestic demand.    But the Finance Ministry spokesman added, In looking at thecurrent situation of the economy and the relationship betweenJapan and the United States, we feel we have to place moreemphasis on stimulating demand.    Economists predict battles within the government over thecoming months as the Finance Ministry fights to ensure thecracks in its policy do not lead to a complete breakdown offiscal discipline.    The Ministry is afraid that once there is a small hole inthe dike, it will lead to a flood, Industrial Banks Taketomisaid.    But Taketomi said the ministry, provided it has a device inplace to check excess spending for political reasons, is likelyto give the goahead to a shift in policy.    This seems to mark the first step toward a more activefiscal policy in response to requests from the internationalcommunity, he said.    Sumitomos Koido said if the government quickly implementsthe LDPs 5,000 billion yen package, economic growth in the198788 year ending next March 31 could be around three pct,His current forecast of 2.2 pct growth assumes a supplementarybudget of around 1,000 billion yen.

Kim, who is also economic planning minister, told a newsconference the countrys banks and finance houses had notdeveloped to keep pace with their industrial counterparts.    He said two major factors had hampered the development ofthe financial sector  high inflation and heavy governmentintervention in bank decisionmaking.    He said in the past the government had pressed banks togive soft loans to industry to boost economic growth.    Kim said the government would now give top priority tointerest rate liberalisation. This could be achieved withinseveral years, though not within one year.    He said liberalisation was possible because South Koreascurrent account had turned from a deficit to a surplus, whichhad brought in foreign funds and increased domestic savings.    The current account recorded a surplus of 4.65 billion dlrsin 1986 after a deficit of 890 mln dlrs in 1985.    But Kim said the government needed to reorganise much ofthe financial sector.    Kim said mergers of some financial companies and theupgrading of others to merchant banks or full banks were beingconsidered by the financial development committee of thefinance ministry. He did not elaborate but said he expected nodrastic measures to be announced this year.    On liberalisation of the countrys stock market, Kim saiddespite Seouls determination to open it up, free investmentsthere by foreigners would not be allowed in the near futurebecause the market was currently overheated. He said this wasdue to ample liquidity created partly by the countrys currentaccount surplus.    Kim said the market was extremely vulnerable to a suddeninflux of foreign funds because it was still very small interms of size and numbers of shareholders.    Opening up the capital market must wait until thevulnerability to such an influx is removed, he said.

  "title": "ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT  AUSTRALIAN MARKETS BOOMING",
  "body": "Australian markets are booming as foreignfund managers redirect capital away from the United States andother traditional markets, analysts said.    High shortterm interest rates, a bullish stock market andan increasingly stable currency reflect a massive inflow offresh funds in the last two months, largely from Japanese andU.S. Investors, analysts polled by Reuters said.    Fund managers want quality markets to park their cash inand have settled on Australia, Britain and Canada as theydiversify from volatile U.S. Dollar instruments, they said.    A one percentage point fall in key 10year bonds rates inthe past month, record share prices and a 10month high for thecurrency of 0.71 U.S. Dlrs all illustrated the inflow.    Official figures on the latest inflow of investment capitalare not available, but brokers said they received almost dailyinquiries from Japan and the United States.    These people have got trillions of dollars sloshing aboutand they dont know what to do with it. Some of that is endingup here with the attraction of high interest rates andreasonable currency stability, National Australia Bank Ltdeconomist Brian Hamley said.    There is a flight to quality, Hamley said. Australia maynot be in the best economic position, but there arent toomany other countries where youd want to put your money.    The stronger Australian dollar was also attractinginvestors taking advantage of an appreciating currency againstthe volatility of the U.S. Unit, analysts said.    Were looking a more favoured market than perhaps the U.S.Where some people would be concerned about the value of theU.S. Dollar, Lloyds Bank NZA Ltd chief economist Will Buttrosesaid. Why not put the money in Australia where entry is cheapand the currency looks stable    But turning that capital into more permanent productiveinvestment depends on government economic policy, he said.    It will only disappear if people lose confidence in thedirection in the economy, Buttrose said, adding that offshoreinvestors would carefully watch the governments promised tougheconomic statement on May 14.    While happy to invest in bonds and other vehicles yieldinginterest unobtainable elsewhere, fund managers could just aseasily reverse the flow  particularly the Japanese, who werebadly hurt in the past by rapid falls in the Australian dollarand hefty jumps in bond rates, analysts said.    It will remain very edgy money. If something was not to bedelivered, if the statement wasnt considered tough enough, onemight see a substantial outflow, Buttrose said.    Offshore investors are eager to see Australia take tougheconomic decisions to curb its 100 billion dlr foreign debt andstubborn current account deficit, analysts said.    They are giving us the benefit of the doubt and I thinkthey would like to leave the money here, Buttrose said.    Reserve Bank policy has also reflected the increasedinterest in investment in Australia and the need to shieldJapanese investors from rapid currency fluctuations.    Reserve Governor Bob Johnston last week acknowledged anelement of targeting the rate against the yen in currencypolicy when he said authorities could not take their eyes offthe yen because of the crucial role of Japanese investors.    Analysts said they believed the Reserve Bank had workedsuccessfully in recent months to keep the Australian dollarwithin the range of 100 to 103 yen.    Apart from its recovery against a weak U.S. Dollar, theAustralian dollar has also risen almost three pct on atradeweighted basis in the last three weeks.    Offshore buying has also played a role in the boomingAustralian share market. It has followed Wall Street and othermarkets, but is also setting its own trend in response to theweight of both domestic and offshore funds pouring intoequities, particularly in the gold sector.    The key all ordinaries index rose to a record 1,758.3today, nearly 20 pct above its level at the end of 1986, whilethe gold index has nearly doubled to a record 3,081.0 in thesame period.    The property sector is also sought after, with Japanesecompanies that have invested heavily in the United States inrecent years turning their attention to undervalued realestate, particularly in the tourism field.    Analysts pointed to the recent sale of Sydneys fivestarRegent Hotel to Japanese interests for more than 145 mln dlrsas indicative of the type of property being sought.    They think they find good value real estate here which,with long term and fixed capital investment, is the kind ofinvestment Australia needs, Buttrose added. REUTER3"

  "title": "ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT  KUWAITI ECONOMY",
  "body": "Kuwaits oilreliant and debtriddeneconomy has started to pull out of a nosedive but oil priceswill determine the pace of recovery, bankers and economistssay.    Crucial will be the ability of the 13member OPEC to holdoil prices around a new benchmark of 18 dlrs a barrel in thenorthern hemisphere summer when demand usually slackens.    Bankers estimate the economy, measured in terms of grossdomestic product gdp, shrank 19 pct in real terms last yearafter contracting 8.1 pct the year before.    This was after taking into account inflation in consumerprices of 1.5 pct in 1985, slowing to 1.0 pct in 1986.    Factors depressing economic activity include the612yearold IranIraq war on Kuwaits doorstep, whichthreatens the emirates vital oil export lifeline through theGulf and has sapped business confidence.    But sentiment received a muchneeded boost in Septemberwhen, after a series of piecemeal steps to combat a debt crisiscaused by the 1982 crash of local stock market, a comprehensivenew debt settlement program was introduced.    The share crash, result of a speculative spree in forwardtrading, left 95 billion dlrs of postdated cheques in default.    The cheques were also used as collateral for consumerspending, thus generating an informal credit system.    Much of the debt has been watered down but big sums arestill owed by individuals and companies.    There was some 4.4 billion dinars about 15.7 billion dlrsin outstanding bank credit at the end of 1986, of whichonequarter to onethird was estimated by bankers to rank asbad or doubtful debt. But the government has repeatedly said itwill not allow any banks to go under.    The new debt settlement scheme entails a rescheduling ofproblem credit over 10 to 15 years, depending on whetherdebtors have regular cash flows or not.    Banks shareholders and depositors will have their rightsguaranteed by the government  an edict of vital significancein a country of only 1.7 mln people where the financial sectoris the biggest after oil.    Kuwait is better placed than any other OPEC country to rideout the oil glut, bankers and economists say.    Kuwait has an OPEC quota of 948,000 barrels per day bpdcompared with production capacity of 4.0 mln bpd mentioned lastyear by Oil Minister Sheikh Ali alKhalifa alSabah.    But strategic diversification into downstream operations inEurope several years ago and a hefty refining investment athome gives it guaranteed markets abroad and enables it to sellover onehalf of its output as highgrade refined oil products.    Oil industry sources say Kuwait is able to get an average2.00 dlrs a barrel more by selling oil in the form of processedproduct such as gas oil, kerosene and naphtha, rather than ascrude.    Bankers say the rebound in oil prices is the major reasonfor cautious optimism. Other reasons are low domesticinflation, a bottoming out of the fall in imports in recentyears and signs government spending on productive sectors willremain steady.    External accounts are in good shape, with an estimated 1.8billion dinar current account surplus in 1986, 16 pct belowthat for 1985, but still an achievement in the recessionhitGulf.    Kuwaits petrodollar reserves in mid1986 were putofficially at over 80 billion dlrs, earning investment incomeof the equivalent of about 3.65 billion dlrs a year.    But for the first time since the end of the oil boom, thesereserves may not be enough to prevent a real budget deficit forthe 198687 fiscal year ending June 30, bankers say.    In a budget portrayed by bankers as mildly contractionary,revenues for 198687 were cut 38.6 pct and spending 11 pct,doubling the nominal deficit to 1.33 billion dinars.    This left out income from state reserves, usually excludedin official budget accounting, which are forecast by bankers atup to 1.0 billion dinars in 198687, resulting in someshortfall.    Bankers say it is too early to venture a forecast foreconomic growth this year or next.    It depends on oil prices, one said. This summer isimportant.    Cabinet Affairs Minister Rashid alRashid said last Sundaythe cabinet has ratified recommendations to rationalise statespending in favour of productive sectors and reactivate theeconomy.    He gave no details but bankers say these are expected to bespelled out in the 198788 budget, possibly in June. REUTER3"

Output in 1987 is expected to reach around 4.5 mln tonnes,unchanged from 1986, because of drought, low use of fertiliserand overstressed palms, they said.    The growers were asked for their reaction to an Oil Worldnewsletter report that Malaysias oil palm output is likely todrop sharply this year.    Palm oil now sells at around 700 ringgit a tonne, or about115 ringgit less than soybean oil, but Malaysia must sell morepalm oil to prevent a stock buildup that could damage theindustry, a leading grower told Reuters.    The countrys palm oil stocks now total some 500,000 tonnesagainst about 800,000 last March, the growers said.    The growers expect palm oil prices to ease later this yeardue to pressure from South American and U.S. Soybean output.    The current South American oilseed harvest, mainly soybean,is likely to be around 25.7 mln tonnes against the previous21.7 mln tonne crop, they said.    In addition, new U.S. Soybean plantings are also expectedto enter the market around November when Malaysian palm oiloutput peaks.    They said new planting of palms is also likely to slow,with some 50,000 hectares expected to be planted with new treesagainst 100,000 in 1986, although the effects of this reductionwill not be felt for about another three years.

  "body": "A bid by San Miguel Corp SMC SANM.MNto buy back 38.1 mln sequestered shares from United CoconutPlanters Bank UCPB has been hit by two new lawsuits, sourcesin the Philippine food and brewery company said.    A Manila court yesterday issued an injunction barring UCPBfrom selling the shares, which represent 31 pct of SMCsoutstanding capital stock of 121 mln shares, until hearings onApril 21 on a petition filed by Eduardo Cojuangco, a formerchairman of both SMC and UCPB.    Cojuangco said the Coconut Industry Investment Fund CIIFand 1.4 mln farmers were the rightful owners of the shares.    Cojuangco said the shares were held in trust by UCPB andrepresented a blue chip investment. His petition said UCPBsplans to sell the shares to SMC were a serious breach offiduciary duties.    The SMC sources said the proposed share sale could also beheld up by a second derivative suit filed before the Securitiesand Exchange Commission SEC by Eduardo de los Angeles, agovernment nominee on the companys board.    De los Angeles, who represents SMCs minority stockholders,asked the SEC to block the transaction, approved last week bythe companys board.    On April 2 the board sanctioned the repurchase of thesequestered shares for 4.79 billion pesos at 126 pesos pershare. De los Angeles told the SEC the companys retainedearnings of 1.33 billion pesos would be wiped out by thepurchase of the shares and would prevent the declaration ofdividends.    De los Angeles said the share purchase would also violatean SMC agreement with its creditors to maintain a 2.2to1 debtto equity ratio. He quoted SMCs chief financial director Ramondel Rosario as telling the board that the transaction wouldboost the ratio to 2.5to1.    In petitioning the SEC, de los Angeles amended an earliersuit two weeks ago in which he charged SMC Chairman AndresSoriano III and nine other directors of violating their duties.    De los Angeles earlier complaint related to SMC assuminglast December a 26.5 mln dlr loan contracted by SMCs Hong Kongsubsidiary Neptunia Corp for a down payment on the shares.The loan assumption was again ratified by last weeks boardmeeting.    An arbitration panel set up by President Corazon Aquino toresolve the ownership issue is expected to submit its report byApril 15.    The amended suit filed by Eduardo de los Angeles is part ofa continuing attempt by certain elements, in complete disregardof the facts and with questionable motives, to delay an earlydisposition of the sequestered shares, San Miguel Corp said ina statement.    Coming as it does, when San Miguel Corp and UCPB havereached agreement on the price of the shares and the method ofpayment, this suit is in direct contravention of thegovernments expressed desire to reach an amicable settlementof the controversy by April 15, the statement added.    A San Miguel spokesman said he had no comment onCojuangcos court petition, adding Any statement coming fromus might be interpreted as adversarial.    Meanwhile, Ramon Diaz, the head of a government panel whichsequestered the shares last year, said Soriano was not eligibleto buy the major portion of the shares because he was a UnitedStates citizen.    The sequestered shares are split into 24 mln A shares,which can only be owned by Filipinos, and 14 mln B shares whichare available to foreign buyers.    SMC sources said Soriano personally was not amongprospective buyers. They said the shares would be purchased bythe A.Soriano group of companies, SMC, Neptunia and unnamedinstitutional investors. Soriano was named as one of the buyersin a bid in March 1986 for 33 mln shares controlled by UCPB.    The sale was aborted when Diazs Presidential Commission onGood Government sequestered the shares on suspicion they wereowned by Cojuangco, a close associate of former PresidentFerdinand Marcos. Cojuangco lives in selfimposed exile in theU.S.. The shares grew to 38.1 mln after a 15 pct stock dividendannounced last June.    We have no objection to Soriano buying the B shares, Diaztold Reuters. But everything is on hold now.    The SMC spokesman said he did not know if the controversywould be resolved before the companys annual stockholdersmeeting, scheduled for May 14.    San Miguel Corp reported sales revenue of 12.2 billionpesos in 1986, 11 pct above its 10.9 billion peso sales in1985. It said unaudited net profit was in the neighbourhood of700 mln pesos, an increase of about 50 pct over 1985. REUTER3"

  "body": "Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehlsaid a weaker dollar would be risky and a further appreciationof the mark would damage prospects for sustained West Germaneconomic growth.    In a speech to the Institute of Contempory German Affairshere, Poehl said It would be an extremely risky policy to aimfor a further substantial decline in the value of the dollar tocorrect the trade deficit.    He said the United States could face a vicious circle ofdepreciation, inflation and more depreciation if it took thatroute.    Poehl noted West Germany had already taken steps to meetU.S. Demands for greater stimulation of its domestic economy,accelerating tax cuts, cutting interest rates and toleratingabovetarget money supply growth.    He said he would have been happy to have brought forwardfive billion marks of tax cuts now planned for January 1988 tothe beginning of this year, but he said the government facedpolitical constraints getting such measures through the upperhouse of the West German parliament.    But there were also limits to the impact West Germany couldaccept on exports from a rising mark, he said.    Poehl said West Germany relied on exports for aboutonethird of its gross national product, so a substantialerosion of export markets could not be offset by increasingdemand at home.    A further appreciation of the mark could even be anobstacle to further growth, he said.    Poehl said the Bundesbank had tolerated rapid money supplygrowth last year because the country enjoyed low inflation andbecause external factors, including low oil prices andfavourable terms of trade, had given some extra leeway.    But Poehl said West Germany now faced a difficult dilemmaover monetary policy.    The underlying rate of inflation was now two pct, not thereported negative inflation rates last year, and West Germanywas affected more than before by exchange rate developments.    For the time being, we will have to focus our policy moreon the external side, and we can live with a more expansionarymoney supply. But we must be very careful, he said.    He said he shared some of the U.S. Concern about Japanstrade surpluses, which affected European countries as well asthe United States.    Poehl welcomed the socalled Louvre accord of monetaryofficials of major industrialized countries, saying theimportance of the February 22 agreement to stabilize exchangerates had been underestimated.    All partners had agreed that the dollar was at about theright level, and that further changes would damage growth, hesaid.    This was a remarkable change in attitude, especially on thepart of our American colleagues, he said.    But he said there was still a danger that the correction ofthe dollars value could overshoot.

  "body": "California regulators said theywere seeking disciplinary action against the accounting firmKMG Main Hurdman as the result of a 1985 audit of TechnicalEquities Corp., an investment firm that filed for bankruptcylast year.    A spokeswoman for the California Board of Accountancy,which certifies public accountants and firms in the state, saida sixpage complaint was filed against the New Yorkbasedaccounting firm.    We basically charged that the Technical Equities audit wasnot conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditingstandards, Della Bousquet, executive officer for the board,told Reuters in a telephone interview.    She said a hearing would probably be held before anadministrative law judge within three months. Penalties couldrange from censure to revocation of KMG Main Hurdmans licenseto do business in California.    KMG Main Hurdman merged last week with Peat MarwickMitchell of New York to become the worlds largest accountingfirm.    The San Francisco office of the firm declined to comment onthe boards allegations.    Bousquet said the company, among other things, was accusedof not properly investigating financial transactions and ofissuing a favorable opinion in August 1985 that relied onmisrepresentations of Technical Equities management.    She said the accounting firm, although it knew TechnicalEquities had severe cash flow and liquidity problems, wasaccused of not performing a proper audit of it.    The complaint named four individuals, including twopartners and two audit managers.    Technical Equities, based in San Jose, filed for protectionunder Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy laws in February 1986,listing debts of 69.7 mln dlrs to 1,068 investors.    Many of the investors were prominent sports andbroadcasting figures."

  "title": "ASEAN SHOWS MIXED PERFORMANCE IN 1986",
  "body": "A sharp oil price decline and sharpfluctuations of exchange and interest rates in 1986 produced amixed economic performance by the Association of SoutheastAsian Nations ASEAN, a United Nations study said.    The annual report of the U.N. Economic and SocialCommission for Asia and the Pacific ESCAP said theinternational economic environment reversed the fortunes of thetradeoriented economies of the six ASEAN member countries.    It said the already low 1985 growth rates of ASEANs oilexporting countries  Brunei, Malaysia and Indonesia dropped further after the oil price fall.    Three oil importers  Singapore, the Philippines andThailand  improved their performance mainly by restructuringtheir economies. But the report said the oil price fall reducedexport earnings, worsening economic prospects for theexporters.    The exporters nonoil commodity prices did not show majorimprovement and protectionist pressures from industrialcountries restricted export of manufactured products, it said.    The GDPs of Indonesia, which was 1.9 pct in 1985, andMalaysia, which fell a real one pct, barely grew in 1986.    The two countries, buffeted by unfavourable externalfactors in the past few years, were forced to curb aggregatedomestic consumption demands last year to avoid severe balanceof payments pressures and to resort to extensive commercialborrowings.    The U.N. Body said the economic outlooks of Singapore,Thailand and the Philippines improved steadily in 1986 as theyear advanced. It said the most favourable factor benefitingthe three was the realignment of key currencies, especially theappreciation of the yen, which has resulted in the increasedcompetitiveness of their exports against those from Japan.    The report said the downward spiral plaguing the Philippineeconomy since 1983 was reversed into an estimated 0.9 pct GDPgrowth in 1986 with agriculture and public utilities becominggrowth sectors.    It said the resumption of the Philippines sustained growthrests largely on a satisfactory solution of its debt problem.    ESCAP said the yen appreciation, together with economicrestructuring measures, played a big role in helping Singaporerecover faster than expected from its 1.8 pct GDP decline in1985.    It said the Singapore GDP achieved a growth of over one pctlast year after registering positive growth from the secondquarter.    The Singapore economic revival was hampered by its ownadjustment measures especially its twoyear wage freezeenforced last April, a glut of its property market anddepressed conditions in its ASEAN neighbours which hurtSingapore because they take about a quarter of its totalexports.    The report said Thailand benefited from the changing worldeconomic environment far more than any of its ASEAN neighbours.    The Thai performance stemmed from the expansion o127 itsnontraditional export items last year to cover moremanufactured products and its greater exploration ofunsaturated export markets such as Asia, the Middle East andthe European Community.

  "body": "Britain and Japan clashed today over U.K.Demands for greater access to the Tokyo Stock Exchange TSE astrade tensions between the two countries mounted.    British consumer affairs minister Michael Howard toldreporters he was dissatisfied with the exchanges response toBritains nonnegotiable timetable for increased Britishmembership and warned of possible reprisals in the future.    He described his meeting with Tokyo stock exchange TSEhead Michio Takeuchi, in which he demanded greater exchangeaccess, as very frank indeed.    In a separate press conference, TSE President MichioTakeuchi said the exchange has done its utmost to liberaliseits membership and called on Britain to make some concessions.    According to Takeuchi, Howard wants three British firms tobe named members of the Tokyo stock exchange by the end of thisyear. Neither Takeuchi nor Howard would name the companies.    Next May is the earliest possible date for opening ourmembership and I want the British government to understandthis, Takeuchi said.    Membership cannot be increased before space on the tradingfloor is expanded in May 1988, he said.     Howard told reporters that was not good enough and saidthat Britain would use its powers to ban Japanese financialinstitutions from London if it was not satisfied with Tokyo.    Japan has until the next meeting of senior officials fromthe two countries in May or June to come up with a postiveresponse to the British timetable or face retaliation, he said.    The timetable was constructed in a way that made it a veryreasonable request and I expect it to be met, he said.    Asked about the exchanges argument that it has no floorspace to expand membership, Howard replied, We find it verydifficult in our country to understand why the considerableingenuity and resourcefulness of the Japanese in worldmarkets is unable to overcome problems of that kind.    While here, Howard said he also expressed frustration withthe huge trade imbalance with Japan and with Tokyos handlingof demands by Britains Cable and Wireless for a greater rolein Japans telecommunications business.    According to Japanese newspaper reports, at least some ofthat message may have penetrated.    According to several reports, the Post andTelecommunications Ministry is considering a Cable and Wirelessproposal for a telephone cable between Japan and the U.S.    Ministry officials were unavailable for comment.

  "body": "Banking supervisory authorities arenot carrying out any special checks at banks in the wake of thecurrency fraud scandal at Volkswagen AG VOWG.F, a spokesmanfor the Hesse regional state central bank, LZB, said.    But inspectors are paying particular attention to foreignexchange matters in their routine checks at banks, he said inanswer to enquiries. There is no evidence rules were broken.    The LZB spokesman was commenting on press reports thatbanks had parked open currency positions for short periods withVW to circumvent regulations limiting the size of open currencypositions that can be carried by banks overnight.    The press allegations emerged after VW said it may havelost 480 mln marks as a result of a possible currency fraud.    LZBs are regional branches of the Bundesbank. Theirinspectors also act for the Federal Banking Supervisory Officein West Berlin, which regulates banking in West Germany.    Following the 1974 Herstatt bank crash on currencyspeculation, West Germany limited a banks total open positionsovernight to 30 pct of shareholders equity and reserves.    German press reports have said some banks circumvented thisrule by selling excess positions to VW, then repurchasing them.    The banking regulations only cover banks. Company foreignexchange activities are not subject to the banking regulators.    The LZB spokesman said there were no concrete signs thatthe regulations had been broken, and it would be irresponsibleto instigate a special check just on the basis of the reports.    The LZBs receive monthly balance sheet statistics frombanks in their areas, which they check, and they also routinelyinspect all banks in greater detail over longer periods.    But LZB officials said it would be hard for inspectors todetect a breach of these rules as they do not check companiesand therefore would not see both sides of any parking deal.    If the managements of the banks have not spotted them, itwill be even harder for our inspectors, said one official.    It would be up to the public prosecutors to order specialchecks on suspicion of breaches of these regulations, theysaid. Prosecutors in Brunswick are already investigating the VWcurrency scandal, and have ordered the arrest of VWs formerchief foreign exchange dealer.    Breaches of the Banking Law in this way can be punished bya 100,000 mark fine for the dealers involved, and in extremecases by removal of the managers if their active involvement isproved. REUTER3"

Speaking to the National Association of Manufacturers,Proxmire said recent insider trading stock scandals increasedthe chance that Congress will act to curb abuses.    We are proposing legislation that would provide for moredisclosure, would be fairer to all shareholders, and wouldinsure that takeovers are properly financed, he said.    Among the provisions, the bill would reduce the thresholdfor notifying the Securities and Exchange Commission that ainvestor or group has acquired a percentage of stock in acompany to three pct from the current five pct threshold within10 days, Proxmire said.    In addition, there would be a prenotificaton requirementthat an investor intended to aquire three pct that would haveto filed with the SEC.    Proxmire said the prenotification requirement was meant toprevent arbitragers from having a jump on the general public inknowing about coming takeover attempts.    Proxmire said he would call for extending the period that atender offer must be kept open under the Williams Act to 60business days from the current 20 business days.    His bill would provide for private suits if the acquiringcompany violated the time period on the tender offer.    To correct abuses in the financing of takeovers, Proxmiresaid the legislation would aim at insuring current marginrequirments are properly enforced.    The Federal Reserve Board has a 50 pct margin requirementfor purchasing stock, but Proxmire said it is not generallyenforced in hostile takeovers.    Rather, the groups or individuals leading a takeoverdeclare that they can raise the capital for a takeover withoutactually putting any of their own money, Proxmire said.    He said his bill would allow private suits for damages forfailure to meet the Federal Reserves 50 pct marginrequirements.    The bill also would require more disclose when severalinvestors form an alliance in a hostile takeover.    When Pickens and Icahn get together we want people to knowabout it, Proxmire said.    Proxmire said he favored the approach used in Britaintowards twotiered tender offers that insures that allshareholders recieve equal treatment.    He said he expected amendments to the bill also would coverdefensive mechanisms such as green mail and poison pills.    Proxmire said he intended to introduce his bill later thismonth and predicted the Senate committee would act this spring.    He said he was hopeful Congress could pass a bill thisyear."

Brazil suspended interest payments on its 68 billion dlrsof medium and longterm debt on February 22.    U.S. banking regulations do not require banks to stopaccruing interest on loans until payments are 90 days overdue,but Bankers Trust said it acted now because of the highpotential of a continued suspension that would result inreaching the 90day limit in the second quarter of 1987.    Assuming no cash payments at current interest rates arereceived for the rest of 1987, Bankers Trust estimated thatfullyear net income would be reduced by about 30 mln dlrs.    Bankers Trust said it assumes that debt negotiationsbetween Brazil and its commercial bank lenders will lead to theresumption of interest payments.    The negotiations resume in New York on Friday when centralbank governor Francisco Gros is expected to ask banks for a90day rollover of some 9.5 billion dlrs of term debt thatmatures on April 15."

  "body": "West German Finance Minister GerhardStoltenberg said todays meetings of major industrial countrieswould look at ways of strengthening the Paris accord onstabilizing foreign exchange rates.    Stoltenberg told journalists he saw no fundamental weaknessof the February 22 agreement of the Group of Five countries andCanada to keep exchange rates near the thencurrent levels.    But he declined to say what measures would be discussedahead of a communique of the Group of Seven ministers latertoday.    Stoltenberg and Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl saidthe importance of the Paris agreement, also known as the Louvreaccord, had been underestimated.    Stoltenberg said there is greater agreement now among majorcountries than six months ago, at the time of the annualmeeting of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank,marked by sharp discord between the United States and its majortrading partners.    There is no fundamental weakness of the Paris accord, hesaid. We will be looking at ways of strengthening it, but I donot want to discuss that here.    Stoltenberg said the Louvre agreement was working despite aslight firming of the yen against the dollar.    And Poehl noted that the dollarmark parity was unchangedsince February 22 without the Bundesbank having had to sellmarks to support the dollar.    The Louvre agreement has been honored by the market, hesaid.    Poehl said West Germany had lived up to its side of thebargain in Paris by preparing the way for tax cuts to beaccelerated as a way of stimulating growth.    Poehl said, however, that Japan had not yet fulfilled itspledges for economic stimulation.    And we will have to see if the United States is able to dowhat they promised in Paris on reducing the budget deficit and get it through Congress, he added.    Stoltenberg reiterated West German concern about a furtherfall in the dollar, noting that the mark was up 85 pct againstthe dollar and nearly 20 pct on a tradeweighted basis.    You cannot expect that to go unnoticed in an economy. Andit is not just a German problem, it is a European problem, hesaid. REUTER3"
